Let me just stop here. Innovation equals invention often people mistake these two things for the same thing. Innovation equals invention, they are not. Innovation is something that generates value for the world. It makes something faster, better, cheaper. It gives someone some great satisfaction. An invention is an idea, a technology, a patent. In and of itself, it does not generate value.  So these two are not the same thing. And sometimes you see them interchange. And that's not correct. So innovation equals invention times commercialization. So and when we look at this equation of innovation something of value, it requires a new idea and then it requires someone or some organization that is going to commercialize that idea, and to make it a value to the world.","orderId":"RL0002","repeated":false,"difficulty":"easy"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1599670932204_stdnew.mp3","answer":"The comics I show you with lots of people chatting around in a room is a form of description.

Now, in this video series what I want to do is I want to talk to you guys about many different topics concerning biology. For example, I want to talk to you guys about DNA and genetics in cells, in bacteria, in life and a whole bunch of interesting stuff. But since this is the very first video, I think what we should do in this video is just stick with the very basics. And the first thing I want to do is talk to you guys about what is biology. So, let's go ahead and answer that question. And the definition of biology is this: the study of life in living organisms. All right, that makes sense up to a certain point up until organisms because you may have heard of organisms before. And you may have your own definition but the scientific definition of an organism is a living thing. Well, that's easy. We know what living things are. I'm a living thing, plants, grass is a living thing. My puppy named old Dan, cutest puppy ever, by the way, is a living thing but whenever we talk about living things. Believe it or not, things get rid of complicated because then you have to ask yourself 'what is life'. Well, of course, if you ask your grandma or your best friend or even if you ask a philosopher 'what is life', everyone is going to give you kind of a different definition of their outlook on life. However, whenever scientist and biologists were first deciding, you know what, what is life? That's the problem that they had everyone had their own separate definition of life itself. So, what they need to do before biology was even invented, which is, of course, the study of life is scientists needed to agree on the definition of life.

The tobacco industry, however, are against this and they in particular argue that the cigarette box is not a form of advertising. Michaela has been doing her PhD looking at cigarette advertising and how it's changed over the last 50 years. Basically, I've accessed advertising from the tobacco industry since the 1950s and just analyze the images and looked at the use of the cigarette box within the adverts. In the very early adverts, the cigarette box is a very small part of the adverts and they focus much more on the social aspects of smoking. However, as you move through the decades and get closer to the present day, the cigarette box became more and more of a focal point in the adverts. My argument is that the cigarette box has actually become iconic to each brand. So when a smoker takes a box out of their pocket, they are actually advertising that brand. So what we hope will come out of this is that the government will introduce plain packaging. And like Australia who have already introduced its policy and Ireland who are again beginning to introduce its policy, we hope that the UK will stop cigarette companies from using their box as a form of advertising.","orderId":"RL0006","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604400288231_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Welcome to today's lesson. We’re continuing with our study of taxonomy. Taxonomy is how scientists classify organisms into different groups based on the characteristics that they share. So, for instance, a good way to think about taxonomy is the US Postal Service. If we want to send a letter to someone, we first start off by addressing it to the nation they are in.  By default, we usually assume that’s America but it doesn't have to be, could be England or Costa Rica or Spain. You put their nation or their kingdom. Then within that kingdom, you address it to a slightly more specific level, their states. So, for instance, South Carolina would be the same as a phylum. And within that state, you would address it to their city and then to their street number, the street they live on.  Then you would address it to say their apartment complex and within that complex, you'd address it by their last name to their family and then finally their first name to the specific person you want to get it to, and in that way, we’re able to weed out all the 400 million people we don't want to send our letter to in America and pinpoint the exact person we want the letter to reach.

These are groups of people that you get together to find out about their opinions and attitudes, for example, to review a piece of work or just basically provide some collective input to help you with whatever you're researching. First of all, how large should a focus group be? Well, I would say that an ideal number of participants is around six or seven. If it's any bigger, what quite often happens is they break into side-conversations and the focus is lost. If it's any smaller, you may not get the range of views that you need to get a really good discussion. Secondly, it's important that you have a moderator for the group, who's able to facilitate and guide the discussions. The moderator must ensure that everyone participates and stop anyone dominating. And also, the moderator needs to make sure that the discussions don't go off in the wrong direction. And thirdly, in order to help the group focus on what's required, some basic materials should be used particularly to kick-start the discussions. This may be in the form of pictures, photos, diagrams, graphs, etc. And will help the group to understand the context of what needs to be discussed.","orderId":"RL0009","repeated":false,"difficulty":"easy"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20220515_1652624157007.mp3","answer":"I'm Steve Pinker and I'm Harvard college professor and Johnstone family professor, Harvard department of Psychology. The Cognitive Revolution which took place at Harvard was the start after modern scientific study of the mind. Who study something like the mind you like to think that you're a scientist, you face the immediate problem of what we do with these things called mental contents, thoughts, emotions, images, plans, rules, you can't see them, you can't taste them, then you can't feel them. If you're a scientist you are supposed to be studying things that you can see measure and manipulate, how do you even begin with a science of mind. Well, the answer is the dominated psychology in the middle part of the 20th century where it just to give up all talks of mental contents. This is the school of behaviorism and came to take over American psychology until the early 1950s when a number of scholars with ties to Harvard started to rethink that whole idea when we talk about how computers work you can't get around computing internal states to them. Computers have memories, they have goal states, they execute plans and if you could do that, about a hunk of metal and you are not being unscientific why should be on the scientific to say those things about a human being.

For ultimate, you can ask how did the behavior evolve and secondly what is the adaptive of significance of the behavior. What’s its purpose? Together these comprise what are called Tinbergen’s 4 questions about animal behavior. Niko Tinbergen was one of the founding fathers of the study of the animal behaviors.

First, the brain builds basic circuits that are responsible for basic skills. And then more complex circuits are built on top of those basic circuits as we develop more complex skills.  Biologically, the brain is prepared to be shaped by experience. It’s expecting the experiences that a young child has to literally influence the formation of its circuity, it’s built into our biology. The interaction between genetics and experience that shapes brain architecture is embedded in the reciprocal relationship, the relationships that children have with the adults in their lives. And by that, we mean what we refer to as the serve and return the nature of children’s interaction with their in adults’ development and the impact of experience on development is not a one-way street, it’s a back and forth interaction.  The brain is a highly integrated organ which has multiple sections that specialized in different kinds of processes. So we have parts of the brain that are involved more in cognitive function and other parts that are involved in processing of emotion and parts involved in scene and hearing. So, if a child is emotionally kind of well put together and socially competent, that will affect more positive and productive learning. And if a child is preoccupied with fears or anxiety or is dealing with considerable stress no matter how intellectually gifted that child might be, his or her learning is going to be impaired by that kind of emotional interference.","orderId":"RL0017","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1599754266933_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Computer scientist Shweta Patel and his team are developing new sensing systems. “The initial focus was really around energy and water monitoring.” They built a new generation of smart sensors that monitor electronic interference on a home’s power line or water pressure changes in the plumbing.

There is quite a different picture when we look at the Math results with no real difference between genders in the results.  What is the explanation for these key differences? To answer this question, researchers look at biological and cognitive factors, and a range of social factors.

And this leads to distinct gender patterns of behavior and skills with direct consequences for school performance and achievement.  The ultimate uses of this evidence (are) to show that biological factors, such as patterns of cognitive developments are closely linked to social factor, such as learned gender categories.

The law states, energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can be described as the ability to do work, where work is the movement of matter when a force is applied to it. A closed system is a system in which no matter or energy is allowed to enter or leave. The first law of thermodynamics tells us that the amount of energy within an ecosystem is constant. It doesn’t change. An open system, on the other hand, allows stuff to come in and go out. Since most systems are not closed, the laws of energy conservation can be rephrased to say that the change in the internal energy of the system is equal to the difference between the amount of energy coming in, minus the amount of energy going out. In other words, the amount of energy in the system can change but only if it comes from another system or goes to another system. At any rate, systems, whether they’re open or closed, do not create or destroy energy. Rather, energy can enter from one system and leave to another.","orderId":"RL0021","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604485539355_stdnew.mp3","answer":"So there are two theories for how the gas giants formed.

It's thought that the gas giants also have a metallic core, but maybe the metallic core not made of iron. Hydrogen, for example becomes metallic at a certain pressure. So it's very possible that the insides of these planets could have metallic cores, could have hydrogen cores, could have rocky portions we're not sure.

However, first I want to go back in history to when the population of cities could be numbered in the thousands rather than millions. One of the earliest theorists of the city was, of course, Plato, who created an ideal city in his text, The Republic. The population of this city would be around twenty-five to thirty thousand at most. Oddly enough, the same figures were chosen by Leonardo da Vinci for his ideal cities. Now, of these twenty five to thirty inhabitants only about five thousand would be citizens. A reason for this might be that it is the largest number that could be addressed publicly at one time and by one person, and makes a voting system much easier to manage.

While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine, in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues.","orderId":"RL0035","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604567029554_stdnew.mp3","answer":"10 years ago, before the use of IPhone or IPad, people's attention interval is about 25 minutes.

The climate change has devastating effects on world economy. The tropical areas on earth are dry and hot, and are originally not suitable for food production. The change of the climate leads to extreme weather conditions such as flood and hurricane, which exacerbates the food production.

And sometimes we need three coordinates to locate some objects in space. So, you can say longitude, latitude and altitude. So if there were more dimensions, you would need more coordinates. Now of course for whatever reason we are not physiologically designed to observe those dimensions, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. One way of thinking about it is, Maybe the best way of thinking about it is the way that someone named Edwin Abbott did it in the late 19th century in a book called flatland. And he said suppose there were two dimensional creatures living in a two dimensional universe. They would have the same trouble conceptualizing three dimensions that we have when we try to conceptualize more than three, such as four. And so, he asked questions like, “What would observers in this two dimensional universe see, say, if a three dimensional object like a sphere passed through the universe?” And what this flatland universe would see would be a series of disks that grow in size and then decreased in size. In the same way that we can certainly think about a two dimensional world inside a three dimensional world, it could be that we observe three dimensions but really there are more. And if a hyper sphere say a four dimensional sphere passed through our universe, we would see a series of spheres that grew in size and then decreased in size.

After industrial revolution around the 19th century, the machinery was widely used in the manufacturing, so the production in factories increased. As a result, circulation of goods became faster, and this led to more accumulation of social wealth. Because of this, the population of middle class expanded and this resulted in the additional accumulation of wealth. This research that conducted by pioneering scientists examined the extent and patterns of structural changes that have occurred in European economies during the recent crisis using some stylized facts on changing output and employment structures at a detailed sectoral level. Focusing mainly on the new EU member states, we compare the performance of various European countries by looking at the differentiated impact of the recent crisis on structural shifts in their economy. We start with stylized facts related to output and employment structures at broader sectorial (NACE-2) level and attempt to find out whether there has been a structural convergence (or divergence) of the New EU Member States (NMS) compared to the more advanced 'old' EU countries (OMS) during the crisis. Finally, we provide also some policy conclusions related to the future role of the NMS in the economy of an integrated Europe, especially in view of post-crisis growth challenges. The financial crisis 2008-2011 adversely affected the manufacturing industry more than services--particularly in terms of employment--and accelerated structural change in favor of the services sector. The latter tendency was more pronounced in the NMS though even here country-specific differences were remarkable. The importance of industry in this group of countries remains strong. There has been no EU-wide uniform pattern of structural change; the formulation of industrial policy at the EU level-- even reaching the 20% target of industry's share in GDP--is challenging and hardly attainable.","orderId":"RL0075","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20210406_1617638283109.mp3","answer":"The topic is the correlation between greenhouse gases and temperature.

These are when participants select from a list of categories for their response, such as male or female or they may include ethnic origin.  Secondly, we have ordinal type questions. These are similar to category questions. But instead of the categories being independent, there is some sort of order between them. If we ask people to indicate their age in categories. This is an ordinal type question.  Thirdly, we have continuous questions. These are any questions that can be answered by a number.

Accurately estimating portion size is critical in research or real-world settings. For example, if you're trying to watch your weight and you're out to dinner and you're presented with a bowl of food, there's no really good way to actually estimate how much you're eating unless you're gonna whip some scales out of your bag.  So we wanted to find a more objective way for people to quantify what they're eating when they're out and about. I came up with a more hands-on approach. We got people to measure the dimensions of the food using the width of their fingers and remembering back to primary school maths. We use the geometric volume formulas to estimate the weight of the food.  To show you how this works, I've ordered a piece of lasagna. And that's my box, a glass of wine and that's my cylinder. And I'm feeling pretty healthy, so I order some watermelon for dessert. And that's my wedge. So this was I know it's seven by five, by four fingers. In the future, I see this method be incorporated into smartphone applications. So you put your finger, it's in along with your height and your weight.

As such, these words and expressions are well defined and listed in standard dictionaries. Colloquialisms, on the other hand, are familiar words and idioms that are understood by almost all speakers of a language and used in informal speech or writing, but not considered appropriate for more formal situations. Almost all idiomatic expressions are colloquial language. Slang, however, refers to words and expressions understood by a large number of speakers but not accepted as good, formal usage by the majority. Colloquial expressions and even slang may be found in standard dictionaries but will be so identified. Both colloquial usage and slang are more common in speech than in writing. Colloquial speech often passes into standard speech. Some slang also passes into standard speech, but other slang expressions enjoy momentary popularity followed by obscurity. In some cases, the majority never accepts certain slang phrases but nevertheless retains them in their collective memories. Every generation seems to require its own set of words to describe familiar objects and events. It has been pointed out by a number of linguists that three cultural conditions are necessary for the creation of a large body of slang expressions. First, the introduction and acceptance of new objects and situations in the society; second, a diverse population with a large number of subgroups; third, association among the subgroups and the majority population. Finally, it is worth noting that the terms 'standard' 'colloquial' and 'slang' exist only as abstract labels for scholars who study language. Only a tiny number of the speakers of any language will be aware that they are using colloquial or slang expressions.

If there's something about the cycle of light and dark that's telling us when to sleep, then shouldn't the sleep cycle of a blind person be different? As it turns out, many blind people—people with no visual perception of light at all—do have the same sleep cycle as sighted people. So now you're wondering, 'How can this happen?' The answer is: hormones, one hormone in particular. It's called melatonin. In sighted people, the level of melatonin goes up at night, or when it's dark, and goes down in the day, or when it's light. It's believed that it's the presence of this hormone in the blood that gives us the urge to sleep. If an increase in melatonin level 'programs' sighted people to sleep at night, then what about blind people? A researcher, named Dr. Charles Czeisler, tells about an interesting experiment. He tried shining a bright light into the eyes of some blind people. When he did this, he noticed that the level of the melatonin in the blood of these subjects went down just as it would do for sighted people. Somehow, the eyes of these subjects, even though they were damaged and had no visual perception of light, could tell their brain when there was more or less light. Now, this doesn't work for all blind people; in fact, most of Czeisler's subjects had no hormonal response to light at all. Further research may be able to explain this sensitivity to light in terms of the type of blindness of the subject.","orderId":"RL0083","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20210523_1621751336976.mp3","answer":"A picture in which a smiling girl holds a pen and adults are behind her.

It included the demolition of crowded and unhealthy medieval neighborhoods, the building of wide avenues, parks and squares, the annexation of the suburbs surrounding Paris, and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts. Haussmann's work met with fierce opposition, and he was finally dismissed by Napoleon III in 1870; but work on his projects continued until 1927. The street plan and distinctive appearance of the center of Paris today is largely the result of Haussmann's renovation.In the middle of the nineteenth century, the center of Paris was overcrowded, dark, dangerous, and unhealthy. In 1845 the French social reformer Victor Considerant wrote 'Paris is an immense workshop of putrefaction, where misery, pestilence and sickness work in concert, where sunlight and air rarely penetrate. Paris is a terrible place where plants shrivel and perish, and where, of seven small infants, four die during the course of the year.' The street plan on the Tie de la Cite and in the neighborhood called the 'quartier des Arcis', between the Louvre and the 'Hotel de Ville' (City Hall), had changed little since the Middle Ages. The population density in these neighborhoods was extremely high, compared with the rest of Paris；in the neighborhood of the Champs—EIysees, there was one resident for every 186 square meters；in the neighborhoods of Arc is and Saint- Avoye, in the present Third Arrondissement, there was one inhabitant for every three square meters. In 1840, a doctor described one building in the tie de la Cite where a single room five meters squares on the fourth floor was occupied by twenty-three people, both adults and children. In these conditions, disease spread very quickly. Cholera epidemics ravaged the city in 1832 and 1848. In the epidemic of 1848, five percent of the inhabitants of these two neighborhoods died. Traffic circulation was another major problem. The widest streets in these two neighborhoods were only five meters wide； the narrowest were only one or two meters wide. Wagons, carriages and carts could barely move through the streets. The center of the city was also a cradle of discontent and revolution；between 1830 and 1848, seven armed uprisings and revolts had broken out in the centre of Paris, particularly along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, around the Hotel de Vi Ile, and around Montagne Sainte Genevive on the left bank. The residents of these neighborhoods had taken up paving stones and blocked the narrow streets with barricades, and had to be dislodged by the army.","orderId":"RL0087","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20220706_1657132335403.mp3","answer":"I understand your professor has been discussing several Eastern Woodland Indian tribes in your study of Native American cultures.

The Mississippian people were city dwellers. But some city residents earned their living as farmers, tending the fields of corn, beans, and squash that surrounded the city.

Usually set up by ordinary citizens, NGOs may be funded by governments, foundations, businesses, or private persons. Some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. The number of NGOs in the United States is estimated at 1.5 million. Russia has 277,000 NGOs. India is estimated to have had around 2 million NGOs in 2009, just over one NGO per 600 Indians, and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in India. NGOs are difficult to define, and the term ‘NGO’ is rarely used consistently. As a result, there are many different classifications in use. The most common focus is on “orientation” and “level of operation”. An NGO’s orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO’s level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.

Throughout history adults have used the power of stories to entertain and amuse their children. But stories are not used merely to entertain youngsters, they have a significant educational purpose. They serve to teach the moral values of their society. In sociological terms, stories are one of the means by which children are socialized. How does this work in practice? Well, it often makes use of heroes, the characters in the stories who the children will admire and want to be like. The heroes of children's stories, therefore, exemplify the qualities valued by that society - they will typically demonstrate courage in the face of difficulty, honesty, consideration for others, loyalty to their family and friends, a respect for work and so on. You can see this happening from the fables of ancient societies through fairy tales and folk tales right up to modern day children's stories. For example, the hard-working ant in Aesop's fable is shown to succeed in comparison with the grasshopper who spends the summer singing and has nothing to eat when winter comes. Similarly, it is Cinderella, the honest, hard-working sister, who wins the Prince rather than her cruel, lazy step-sisters.

She was known to be a pretty unusual woman. She smoked a pipe and chewed tobacco. Anyway, in the summer of 1778, at the Battle of Monmouth, it was a blistering hot day, maybe over a hundred degrees, and fifty soldiers died of thirst during the battle. Molly wasn't content to stay back at camp. Instead, she ran through gunshots and cannon fire carrying water in pitchers from a small stream out to the thirsty American soldiers. The relief that she brought with her pitchers of water gave her the legendary nickname Molly Pitcher.

So, um - by the 1950s, air pollution was very visible with frequent thick black fogs known as 'smogs' in many large cities around the world. The main source of this pollution was from factories and it caused severe health problems. For example, a particularly severe smog in London in 1952 caused over four thousand deaths.Obviously something had to be done and in 1956 a Clean Air Act was introduced in Britain. This addressed the pollution from factories and the smogs soon disappeared. However, as you know, these days air pollution is still a big issue. The main difference between now and the 1950s is that you can't see it - it's invisible. Also, themain source of pollution now is from cars and lorries, and although these don't produce visible signs, this air pollution is still a significant risk to health.And one of the key factors in the rise of this type of pollution is that we have all become much more vehicle-dependent. There are far more cars and lorries, trains and planes than in the 1950s and this is now the main source of air pollution around the world.","orderId":"RL0103","repeated":false,"difficulty":"easy"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1599883010555_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Here are three important factors in creativity: people, process and product.

Human beings can survive and prosper largely depending on the creativity they have. If you identify and assess the creativity of a finished product, it is taken as a proxy for the creativity of the person who produced such a product.

Of course there's lots of sugar in donuts of ice cream, or pastries, or other things that are sweet; candy of course, but there are other places where you see it and you don't necessarily expect it. So as an example: peanut butter. Here's a list of ingredients from Skippy Peanut Butter and you see that sugar is the second most common ingredient. So that you may know from the reading food labels that these ingredients in any food labels that are listed in order of how much there is in the food itself, so sugar comes right after peanuts. Here's another example, Beef stew, you wouldn't necessarily expected to find sugar in beef stew but it's there. Now it's down the list of ingredients, it's actually toward the end, but if you look at the marketing of this and food at the can, it says, there's fresh potatoes and carrots, but actually there's more sugar in this than there is carrots.

When you entered as first-year students this year, the school assigned you to a dorm and a roommate, but next year as returning students you'll choose both your roommate and your dorm. But whether or not you actually get to live in your first choice depends on what number you or your roommate draws in the lottery system. The system gives priority to the students who have been here longest. Fourth-year students get the first block of numbers, third-years get the second block, and second-years—like you'll be—get the third. The lower the number you draw, the sooner you choose. Number one gets the first choice, number two gets the second choice, and so on. You can use either your own or your intended roommate's number to make your room choice. If your roommate for next year has been at the school longer than you have, they'll be in a better block of numbers and so will have a better number than any second-year student. But most of you will probably be rooming with other second-year students and so neither of you may have a great number. You may not get into your first or even second choice. Of course, if you've made plans to live off campus, you don't need to enter the lottery at all. Dorm space will be especially tight this year because the dorms on North Campus will be closed for renovations. This means that those of you who draw the worst numbers won't be able to get dorm housing at all.

Before we begin our nature walk today, I'd like to give you a short history of our National Park Service. The National Park Service began in the late 1800's. A small group of explorers had just completed a month-long exploration of the region that is now Yellowstone. They gathered around a campfire, and after hours of discussion, they decided that they should not claim this land for themselves. They felt it should be accessible to everyone. So they began a campaign to preserve this land for everyone's enjoyment. Two years later, in the late nineteenth century, an act of Congress signed by President Ulysses S. Grant proclaimed the Yellowstone region a public park. It was the first national park in the world. After Yellowstone became a public park, many other areas of great scenic importance were set aside, and in 1916 the National Park Service was established to manage these parks. As a park ranger, I am an employee of the National Park Service. In a national park, park rangers are on duty at all times to answer questions and help visitors in any difficulty. Nature walks, guided tours, and campfire talks are offered by specially training staff members. The park service also protects the animals and plants within the parks.","orderId":"RL0108","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20230310_1678459285977.mp3","answer":"The biotech engineering has undergone three phases.

What a wonderful question. I wish I had a wonderful answer to go with it. Here is the problem, there is actually a law of physics called the third law of thermodynamics, that says you cannot get to the absolutely zero, but we don' t really know it’s true, but we are pretty sure it is for the following reason: every time you think of some way of cooling something down a little bit, it means you try to get energy out of that thing and make the temperature lower. Well if you can get energy out, usually there is a way that the energy can go in as well. And that always means there is a competition between taking the energy out and putting the energy in. Now you can try to make it, so you are favoring getting energy out, but you can’t completely stop the energy from going in and that means you might be able to get colder and colder, but you won' t be able to get all the way to absolute zero. Could we go back to my power point, because I think that one of these slides will illustrate that point a little bit better. Yes, here, remember the logarithmic thermometer? There is no zero on this logarithmic thermometer, just keeps going down, you make it a fact of 10 colder, you' re not a zero. You make it a fact of 10 colder, you’re still not a zero. You make it a fact of 10 colder, you' re still not a zero. So, you start a million of a degree, now you are 10 millions of a degree, now you are 100 millions of a degree. Now you are billions of degree. You never get to zero that way. You get closer and closer, but you never get to zero.

You'll find that grains are easy to prepare. Many grains are as simple to cook as spaghetti. Barley, for instance, is just cooked in salted water. Remember, though, whole-grain barley, the most nutritious kind, never will get as tender as spaghetti no matter how long it's cooked. Grain-based salads are easy, too. Just use grains left over from a hot meal. You call even put together a grain salad hours before you need it, since grains don't wilt like lettuce does.

The available evidence seems to indicate fairly conclusively that land and sea temperatures started to increase around 200 years ago. So, what's the significance of this! Well, 200 years ago roughly coincides with the beginning of the industrial revolution in the northern hemisphere. In other words, this was when our production of harmful gases really got going as a result of increased industrialization. Since that time our production of gases has accelerated due to the fact that not only has industry grown in size but it has also now spread to the southern hemisphere, indeed, most parts of the world.

This reflects the environmentalists' maxim, 'think globally act locally'. United Kingdom legislative control over the impacts of mans' activity on the environment is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of 'sea coal. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by 'self- regulation' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect. The next stage was prompted by the Industrial Revolution with the urbanization of society and its profound effects on the environment. Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximize their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of 'Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good.

At various times as soldier, journalist, author, and politician, Churchill is generally regarded as one of the most important leaders in British and world history.  Considered reactionary on some issues such as granting independence to Britain's colonies, and at times regarded as a self-promoter, who changed political parties to further his career, it was his wartime leadership that earned him iconic status. Some of his peacetime decisions such as restoring the Gold Standard were disastrous as was his World War 1 decision to land troops on the Dardanelles. However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler's Nazi Germany in the free world, his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people during their darkest hour.  Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny, and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny. Indeed, he believed that God had placed him on earth to carry out heroic deeds for the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. A providential understanding of history would concur with Churchill's self-understanding.  Considered old-fashioned, even reactionary by some people today, he was actually a visionary whose dream was of a united world, beginning with a union of the English speaking peoples, then embracing all cultures. In his youth, he cut a dashing figure as a cavalry officer as seen in the 1972 film Young Winston (directed by Richard Attenborough), but the images of him that are the most widely remembered are as a rather overweight, determined, even pugnacious looking senior statesman as he is depicted to the right.","orderId":"RL0274","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1788537_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_stdnew.mp3","answer":"The sound of a cracking knee isn't particularly pleasant. But it gets worse when you listen up close. 'It does for most people. But for me, it just makes me excited.' Omer Inan, an electrical engineer at Georgia Tech. 'I actually feel like there's some real information in them that can be exploited for the purposes of helping people with rehab.'  Inan's experience with cracking knees goes back to his days as an undergrad at Stanford, where he threw discus. 'If I had a really hard workout, then the next day of course I'd be sore, but I'd also sometimes feel this basically catching or popping or creaking every now and then in my knee.'  A few years later, he found himself building tiny microphones at a high-end audio company. So when he got to Georgia Tech and heard the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, wanted better tech for knee injuries, he thought: Why not strap tiny microphones to people's knees, to eavesdrop as their legs bend?' What we think it is, is the cartilage and bone rubbing against each other, the surfaces inside the knee rubbing against each other, during those movements.'  He and a team of physiologists and engineers built a prototype with stretchy athletic tape and a few tiny mics and skin sensors. And preliminary tests on athletes suggest the squishy sounds the device picks up are more erratic, and more irregular, in an injured knee than in a healthy one, which Inan says might allow patients and doctors to track healing after surgery. Details appear in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.  'The primary application we're targeting at first is to give people a decision aid during rehabilitation, following an acute knee injury, to help them understand when they can perform particular activities, and when they can move to different intensities of particular activities.' A useful thing to take a crack at.","orderId":"RL0275","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604564825912_stdnew.mp3","answer":"This lecture talks about the health trainings for community service workers.

To be clear, being conscious is being aware and being competent is being proficient, capable, or knowledgeable about something.  Unconscious incompetence is when you don't understand something or aren't very good at it, and either don't know you are bad at it, or don't believe you are bad at it. Once you know you aren't great at something, you have advanced to conscious incompetence. This is a vital step, perhaps, one of the most important. If you know you don't understand something, you can seek out an act upon feedback accordingly.  Eventually you'll get to conscious competence where you are now capable or proficient at something, but it still takes a significant amount of effort. Again knowing that you have yet to master the desired skill is necessary in order to keep practicing, keep seeking feedback, and keep striving towards mastery.

Early in the decade sales were down, so publishers started looking for some new angle to get their readers interested again. They found what they were looking for with horror comics, stories about ghosts and demons that were often graphically violent. Before long, most of the major publishers were printing horror comics, but it all came to an end a few years later. You see, there was a psychologist named Frederic Wertham who claimed that comic books, the horror books in particular, were a bad influence on children and turned them into juvenile delinquents. Wertham even wrote a book called Seduction of the Innocent that showed specific scenes from comics that he thought were a particularly bad influence on kids. Wertham wasn't the only one down on comics. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency also released a report very critical of comics. The result of all this fuss was the creation of the Comics Code Authority in 1995. This is a self- censoring body created by the publishers. Essentially, for a comic book to be approved by the code, it had to be free of the blood and gore that was usually depicted in most horror comics, and evil could never triumph over good. Children had to be shown that crime did not pay. Well, if comic sales were bad in 1950, things got even worse in 1955. Many small publishers actually went out of business. But the industry rebounded by introducing a new lineup of superheroes, characters like Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four. Now, I've brought with me today some comic books from this era to pass around. They're from my own personal collection, so please be extra careful when handling them.","orderId":"RL0294","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1683546154040.mp3","answer":"The western countries women are becoming more and more reluctant to give birth to babies.

I want you to look inside the bomb calorimeter inside here, you can see that there’s a silver bucket water goes all in here and this is actually the bomb is the smaller silver cylinder what you do is put your fuel sample in there then these two electrodes are connected to the bomb. These provide the spark that will ignite your sample when your sample burns or combust that gives off energy. So how is the energy collected or how did a scientist figure out how much energy is being given off. Well, it’s a closed system, there’s a lid here that goes on top of this calorimeter and what’s in here in the lid is a stirrer. The stir is going to stir the water. That’s in this big pool here so that the heat given off from the sample is going to warm the water in a uniform way. This is the temperature probe, this goes down in the water also and measures the change in temperature because as the sample is burned, it will give off heat and the temperature the water will increase. So the lid goes on the sample is prepared. The last thing that you need to make a combustion reaction happen is oxygen and at some point during the process, some oxygen is added by a tank. That’s connected to the calorimeter here. So we are going to burn a sample of the biodiesel that you’ve prepared and get some feedback on the energy content of it.

When you're creating a new website you really need to think about who the users are and what information they'll be looking for. What we do when we set up websites is to group users based on their needs. So, for a website in the academic community, for example, we may have groups such as researchers and administrators, and this helps us design the site and add information that is relevant to each group. The second point is accessibility. The main thing here is to ensure your website can be found. And you can do this by making sure it can be reached from areas on the web where your target audience are also active. So this may mean providing links on other websites or maybe using social media.

Some astronomers work on purely theoretical problems and never use a telescope at all. You might not know how rarely images are viewed directly through telescopes. The most common way to observe the skies is to photograph them. The process is very simple. First, a photographic plate is coated with a light-sensitive material. The plate is positioned so that the image received by the telescope is recorded on it. Then the image can be developed, enlarged, and published so that many people can study it.

Hi, I'm Doctor James Meschino. There is a fatty liver condition known as NASH. That is commonly seen in diabetics, pre-diabetics and people who are overweight. NASH stands for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a condition where you have an inflamed liver that is not caused by alcohol consumption. It is caused b faulty lifestyle behaviors, lots of fat in the diet in particular. Of course, alcohol consumption can also induce fatty liver problems. But with the obesity epidemic that we have at hand, more and more people are developing fatty liver disease, not from alcohol but from faulty dietary lifestyle patterns and lack of exercise. If it is left unchecked, fatty liver problems can degenerate into cirrhosis. In cirrhosis of the liver, you are getting scar tissue and fibrotic tissue. Nodules start to replace normal liver tissue. With advancing cirrhosis, you can end up with liver failure, requiring a liver transplant. Cirrhosis is the tenth leading cause of death in men in our society. It is the twelfth leading cause of death in women in our society as of 2001. In 2012, new medical guidelines were issued for the management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. One of the major recommendations was 800 IUs of vitamin E every day. Why? Well, vitamin E is one of the few agents that has been shown to actually reverse some of the liver damage in people that have this problem. Other studies have also shown recently that vitamin E is linked to prevention of liver cancer in people who are high risk for primary liver cancer.

Even true chocoholics might not know what their favorite treat has in common with yogurt, cheese, and wine: its flavors come from fermentation. Fermentation is the process of improving a food through the controlled activity of microbes. The food you know as chocolate starts its life as the seeds of football-shaped fruit. Farmers scoop out the seeds and pulp into piles or boxes. The seeds are now called 'cacao beans'. They ferment for about a week before they're dried, roasted, and crushed with sugar until smooth and ready to eat. Let's go back to that fermentation step. Cacao fermentation is a multi-stage process. The first stage involves yeast. Just like the yeast in your beer, yeast in a cacao fermentation produces alcohol by digesting the sugary pulp around the beans. As the pulp breaks down, oxygen seeps in. And oxygen-loving bacteria take over. The bacteria generate acetic acid from the alcohol that the yeast produced. Acetic acid causes biochemical changes as it soaks into the beans, and that has a major impact on flavor. Finally, as the acid slowly evaporates and the sugars are all used up, spore-forming organisms begin to grow. Cacao is a wild fermentation. Farmers rely on natural microbes in their environment to create unique, local flavors.","orderId":"RL0311","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20210406_1617638672341.mp3","answer":"The amount of money drug companies spend on TV ads has doubled in recent years. Studies show they work: Consumers go to their doctor with a suggestion for a certain prescription drug they saw advertised on TV. Now a study in the Annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message the ads promote. You’re most likely to see drug ads during prime time, especially around the news. Researchers analysed ads aimed at people with conditions like hypertension, herpes, high cholesterol , depression, arthritis and allergies. The drug industry says the ads arm consumers with information. Researchers found that the information was technically accurate, but the tone was misleading. ”Typically, what we would see with these ads is that before taking a particular prescription drug, the character’s life is out of control and the loss of control extended beyond the impact of their health condition says UCLA psychologist Dominick Frosch, who headed the study. For example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days. Insomniacs were utterly out of23 synch on the job. Depressed patients were friendless and boring at parties. ”When the character is then shown taking the drug, he then magically regains complete control of his life.” Frosch notes. None of the ads mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition . That’s not surprising, given that the ads are just another form of mass marketing. But prescription medicines are not soap. Sample answer：The lecture was about advertising. He mentioned that the advertisement on medicine prescription has doubled, compared to its prime time. People buy drugs depending on what they saw on the ads. Despite medicine ads may be technically accurate, they are misleading in tones. Depression patients, for example, may feel better after taking the medicine. However, it does not mean there is a change in their life style. Therefore, buying the prescription medicine is not like buying a soap, it takes a sober mind and careful decision and understanding of what we really need to improve.","orderId":"RL0312","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20211102_1635863589452.mp3","answer":"Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura. The oldest fossil proto frog appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is found in tropical rain forests. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semipermeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in they are breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one-third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them. Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion.","orderId":"RL0314","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1599490671708_stdnew.mp3","answer":"It’s hard to make a robot complete a task that seems extremely simple for a human.

Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40000to 43000 years Before Present, while the upper range supported by others is 60000 to 70000 years BP.In any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass( known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.The ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversity and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However ,the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Penisula.During the 1970s and 1980s around 120000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration AI Grass by termed 'multiculturalism'. In 2004-5, Australia accepted 123000 new settles , 19 a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40000 in 200405) moved to Sydney.

It is more important than ever to understand how autocracies work. Autocrats have a keen interest in promoting the idea that they are all powerful. Whereas leaders in democracies can be removed via elections, leaders in autocracies can lose office in two ways: via a coup or popular revolt. To make matters worse, autocrats can rarely address both threats at the same time. They often have to choose whether to reward their elite cronies to prevent a coup or the masses to prevent a revolt. This generates many difficult tradeoffs. Cheat too little on elections and risk losing office, but cheat too much and signal weakness to your opponents. Use corruption to reward your elite friends, but not so much that it slows economic growth and sparks a revolt. Manipulate the media, but not so much that people turn off the television.

It included the demolition of crowded and unhealthy medieval neighborhoods, the building of wide avenues, parks and squares, the annexation of the suburbs surrounding Paris, and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts. Haussmann's work met with fierce opposition, and he was finally dismissed by Napoleon III in 1870; but work on his projects continued until 1927. The street plan and distinctive appearance of the center of Paris today is largely the result of Haussmann's renovation.In the middle of the nineteenth century, the center of Paris was overcrowded, dark, dangerous, and unhealthy. In 1845 the French social reformer Victor Considerant wrote 'Paris is an immense workshop of putrefaction, where misery, pestilence and sickness work in concert, where sunlight and air rarely penetrate. Paris is a terrible place where plants shrivel and perish, and where, of seven small infants, four die during the course of the year.' The street plan on the Tie de la Cite and in the neighborhood called the 'quartier des Arcis', between the Louvre and the 'Hotel de Ville' (City Hall), had changed little since the Middle Ages. The population density in these neighborhoods was extremely high, compared with the rest of Paris；in the neighborhood of the Champs—EIysees, there was one resident for every 186 square meters；in the neighborhoods of Arc is and Saint- Avoye, in the present Third Arrondissement, there was one inhabitant for every three square meters. In 1840, a doctor described one building in the tie de la Cite where a single room five meters squares on the fourth floor was occupied by twenty-three people, both adults and children. In these conditions, disease spread very quickly. Cholera epidemics ravaged the city in 1832 and 1848. In the epidemic of 1848, five percent of the inhabitants of these two neighborhoods died. Traffic circulation was another major problem. The widest streets in these two neighborhoods were only five meters wide； the narrowest were only one or two meters wide. Wagons, carriages and carts could barely move through the streets. The center of the city was also a cradle of discontent and revolution；between 1830 and 1848, seven armed uprisings and revolts had broken out in the centre of Paris, particularly along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, around the Hotel de Vi Ile, and around Montagne Sainte Genevive on the left bank. The residents of these neighborhoods had taken up paving stones and blocked the narrow streets with barricades, and had to be dislodged by the army.","orderId":"RL0326","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604400243540_stdnew.mp3","answer":"When you think of a leader, you may think of an individual who is above all bold. But a new study of fish called sticklebacks shows that shy individuals actually prefer to follow fish that are similarly timid. Researchers had trios of sticklebacks with known personalities play follow the leader. The fish were placed in a tank that had some plastic plants at one end and some food hidden at the other. In some of the groups, a bold fish and a shy fish acted as leaders, while another shy fish followed. And in other groups, it was a bold fish that did the following. The researchers recorded whether the follower sallied forth more frequently with the fish that was behaviorally similar or the one that was different.  What they found is that shy fish were more likely to emerge from under cover when an equally wary fellow was already out there. Bold follower fish did not seem to care which leader they followed.  Of course, no matter which fish a stickleback chose to stick with, the bold fish did lead more expeditions over the course of the experiment than their more retiring friends. That’s because the bold fish initiated more trips, regardless of who might be tailing them. The findings are in the journal Biology Letters.  The researchers write that “when offered a choice of leaders, sticklebacks prefer to follow individuals whose personality matches their own, but bolder individuals may, nevertheless, be able to impose their leadership, even among shy followers, simply through greater effort.” We may soon see if such tendencies also hold true in humans, when Americans decide who they’ll follow in November.","orderId":"RL0328","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1788532_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_stdnew.mp3","answer":"In our survey, over a hundred CEOs who had recently been through an acquisition or merger were asked which areas of their activities needed the most effort.

The long-legged and speedy Cataglyphis fortis normally covers ground with a three-legged stride that moves two legs forwards on one side, and one on the other. For the next step, the insect mirrors the move with its other three legs. But recordings of ants in the Tunisian desert reveal that when faced with oversized lumps of food 10 times their own weight, the forward “tripod” walking style is abandoned. Unable to lift the morsels in their mandibles, the ants drag the food backwards instead, moving all six legs independently. “This is the first time we have seen this in any ants,” said lead author Sarah Pfeffer at the University of Ulm in Germany. The ants’ long legs already help keep their bodies away from the scorching desert floor and enable them to speed around at up to 60cm per second. “Think of Usain Bolt, who has very long legs compared to body size. The desert floor is also very hot, so the further away their bodies are from the surface, the better,” said co-author Matthias Wittlinger. The ants have also evolved to function at body temperatures of 50C in a desert where temperatures can soar to 70C. “They’re basically just trying to get out of the heat,” he added.","orderId":"RL0344","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1788526_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_stdnew.mp3","answer":"My name is Evie Carroll, I am a second-year sitting in International Business.

We are usually given reading list which we have to complete before each tutorial, we are given websites to look at, e-journals to look at, and we have to prepare by writing our notes down.  In every tutorial, there is about five to fifteen students, and led by the tutors, which are usually masters or PHD students. And then when we come into the tutorial, we are put into small groups, and we are asked to discuss our ideas, generate new ideas, and then feedback to the class. During our tutorials, there’s lots of support given, our tutors are there so that we can ask questions at any time. We also have our peers there which we can also ask questions to. If we need help before the tutorial, we can email in any of the tutors and they’ll provide you with help.  The difference between lectures and tutorials is that in lectures, you usually have about 200 to 300 students; whereas in tutorials, there is about 5 to 15 students which allows you to discuss matters, put you hand up, and talk to your tutors about any difficulties you may have with the subject.","orderId":"RL0345","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604727720976_stdnew.mp3","answer":"This lecture compares the conditions on the earth and Mars, as well as the habitability of Mars.

For ultimate, you can ask how did the behavior evolve, and secondly what is the adaptive significance of the behavior, what's its purpose. Together these comprise what are called Tinbergen's four questions about animal behavior. Niko Tinbergen was one of the founding fathers of the study of animal behavior.

It is an electronic revolution of sorts, made possible by the marriage of  television and computer technologies. The word 'television', derived4 from its Greek (tele: distant) and Latin (visio: sight) roots, can literally5 be interpreted as sight from a distance. Very simply put, it works in this way: through a sophisticated system of electronics, television provides the capability6 of converting an image (focused on a special photoconductive plate within a camera) into electronic impulses, which can be sent through a wire or cable. These impulses, when fed into a receiver (television set), can then be electronically reconstituted into that same image. Television is more than just an electronic system, however. It is a means of expression, as well as a vehicle for communication, and as such becomes a powerful tool for reaching other human beings. The field of television can be divided into two categories determined by its means of transmission. First, there is broadcast television, which reaches the masses through broad-based airwave transmission of television signals. Second, there is nonbroadcast television, which provides for the needs of individuals or specific interest groups through controlled transmission techniques. Traditionally, television has been a medium of the masses. We are most familiar with broadcast television because it has been with us for about thirty-seven years in a form similar to what exists today. During those years, it has been controlled, for the most part, by the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS, who have been the major purveyors of news, information, and entertainment. These giants of broadcasting have actually shaped not only television but our perception of it as well. We have come to look upon the picture tube as a source of entertainment, placing our role in this dynamic medium as the passive viewer.","orderId":"RL0370","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604400125650_stdnew.mp3","answer":"In 1943, what became known as the Green Revolution began when Mexico, unable to feed its growing population, shouted for help. Within a few years, the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations founded the International Rice Research Institute in Asia, and by 1962, a new strain of rice called IR8 was feeding people all over the world. IR8 was the first really big modified crop to make a real impact on world hunger.  In 1962 the technology did not yet exist to directly manipulate the genes of plants, and so IR8 was created by carefully crossing existing varieties: selecting the best from each generation, further modifying them, and finally finding the best. Here is the power of modified crops: IR8, with no fertilizer, straight out of the box, produced five times the yield of traditional rice varieties. In optimal conditions with nitrogen, it produced ten times the yield of traditional varieties.  By 1980, IR36 resisted pests and grew fast enough to allow two crops a year instead of just one, doubling the yield. And by 1990, using more advanced genetic manipulation techniques, IR72 was outperforming even IR36.

The earlier Paris had been in part a maze of narrow streets and alleyways.

Conservation biologists need to know what animals do if they're going to save them.  Are those animals social or solitary? How much space do they need and how many mates do they have? Sometimes you can’t predict the outcome of the research. Fernando Nottebohm started out being interested in how birds know what to sing.

There's a lot of interest in what forms those clouds. Why are those clouds there, why do they stick around? At the center of every cloud drop is a particle. You can't grow a cloud drop without having a particle there for the water to condense on. The key questions that people have not directly addressed until very recently is what actually forms those clouds. And so the ones that you’re looking at over the ocean, it turns out sea salt is a very effective nucleator for forming clouds,, so there’s a really good chance that those are loaded with sea salt. But as you go inland you start to have pollution come from all different kinds of sources, and so different sources form clouds more effectively than others. And we're trying to unravel which sources are actually contributing to the clouds. The clouds are incredibly important players in climate change in that they reflect the light back to space, and so they're keeping things much, much cooler than they would be if they weren't there. They also play a huge role in regional weather. So we're actually starting to see shifts where having more pollution input into the clouds is affecting weather patterns, and in particular it's actually reducing the amount of precipitation, so we're starting to see drought in areas with super high levels of air pollution.","orderId":"RL0378","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604400158595_stdnew.mp3","answer":"So, when we talk about the polar regions, just to clarify exactly what we mean.

First, I want you to try and remember learning how to ride a bike. Maybe you have a scar you received when you flipped over the handlebars. The next thing I want you to remember is how to ride a bike. The reason I asked you to recall both of these memories is that they belong to two different designated realms of memory. Memory is a fluid and dynamic system that is exceedingly complicated. To this end, psychologists have attempted to divide memory up to make it easier to study. There are two main categories. Explicit memory is a memory that can be intentionally and consciously recalled. This is your memory of riding a bike and falling over the handlebars, and skinning your knee. The other is implicit memory which is an exponential functional form of memory that cannot be consciously recalled. This is your memory of how to ride a bike or how to balance. These are often not tied to a visual memory, but a more like muscle memory. The examples of implicit memory include using language naturally, driving and reading, and answering multiple questions in the test, etc., will be natural. Let's look at explicit and implicit memory in a little more detail, and see how age influences these. It is an experimental or functional form of memory. Explicit memory consists of a great deal of highly personal memories related to time, space and people. It is totally different from implicit memory.

It is very unfortunate that many of the Native Americans are living under poor conditions throughout the country. In the cases of native Alaskans, even virtually entire villages are suffering from a lack of mental and emotional well-being, which includes continuing poor physical and mental health. Alcohol abuse, domestic violence, homicides, and suicides are frequent among them, which of course, lead to families falling apart. It is tragic to see that many children are abused and not educated properly. As a matter of fact, the children themselves are abusing alcohol and other chemicals, and the rate is increasing over the time. Since parents are suffering from mental illnesses and alcohol abuse, they can't take care of their children, so many children are being taken care of by others or simply neglected. Therefore, we can conclude that Alaskan natives are losing hold of their communities, cultural identities, and most importantly, their childhoods. So you can see how serious the issue is.

But these days, that’s no longer the case. A new study by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, examined how 15-year-old boys and girls performed at reading, mathematics, and science. Boys still score somewhat better at maths, and in science the genders are roughly equal. But when it comes to the students who really struggle, the difference is stark: boys are 50% more likely than girls to fall short of basic standards in all three areas. Researchers suggest that doing homework set by teachers is linked to better performance in maths, reading, and science. Boys, it appears, spend more of their free time in the virtual world; they are 17% more likely than girls to play collaborative online games than girls every day. They also use the internet more. Third, peer pressure plays a role. A lot of boys decide early on that they are just too cool for school which means they’re more likely to be rowdy in class. Teachers mark them down for this. In anonymous tests, boys perform better. In fact, the gender gap in reading drops by a third when teachers don’t know the gender of the pupil they are marking. So what can be done to close this gap? Getting boys to do more homework and cut down on screen-time would help.. But most of all, abandoning gender stereotypes would benefit all students.

The majority of sleep-clinic patients suffer from disorders of excessive sleep, or 'hypersomnia.' While most insomniacs somehow manage to drag themselves through the day and function at acceptable, although not optimal levels, this is not so for people who suffer from hypersomnia. They are incapacitated by irresistible urges to sleep during the day, often in inappropriate situations--at business meetings, in supermarkets, or at parties. Even more dangerous is their failure to remain awake when driving or operating machinery. Falling asleep in such situations could obviously be life-threatening. Many hypersomniacs suffer from narcolepsy, for which the primary symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness. Though not apparent in childhood, this symptom most often appears for the first time during the teen years and continues throughout a person's life. The sleep attacks may occur as many as fifteen to twenty times during the course of the day and last for periods from fifteen minutes up to two hours.

Although we tend to think of electric cars as being something completely modern, they were in fact some of the earliest types of motorized vehicle. At the beginning of the twentieth century electric cars were actually more popular than cars with an internal combustion engine as they were more comfortable to ride in. However, as cars fuelled by petrol increased in importance, electric cars declined. The situation became Such that electric vehicles were only used for certain specific purposes - as fork-lift trucks, ambulances and urban delivery vehicles, for example. Although electricity declined in use in road vehicles, it steadily grew in importance as a means of powering trains. Switzerland, for example, was quick to develop an electrified train system, encouraged in this no doubt by the fact that it had no coal or oil resources of its own. Nowadays there is renewed interest in electricity as a means of powering road vehicles. Why is this the case? Well, undoubtedly economic reasons are of considerable importance. The cost of oil has risen so sharply that there is a strong financial imperative to look for an alternative. However, there are also environmental motivations. Emissions from cars are blamed in large part for - among other things - the destruction of the ozone layer and the resultant rise in temperatures in the polar regions.

But, this wasn't always the case. In the early days of radio, stations were capable of broadcasting only a narrow range of sounds, which was all right for the human voice but music didn't sound very good. There was also a great deal of crackling and other static noises that further interfered with the quality of the sound. A man named Edwin Armstrong, who was a music lover, set out to change this. He invented FM radio, a technology that allowed stations to send a broad range of frequencies that greatly improved the quality of the music. Now, you'd think that this would have made him a millionaire; it didn't. Radio stations at that time had invested enormous amounts of money in the old technology. So the last thing they wanted was to invest millions more in the new technology. Nor did they want to have to compete with other radio stations that had a superior sound and could put them out of business. So they pressured the Federal Communications Commission, the department of the United States government that regulates radio stations, to put restrictive regulations on FM radio. The result was that its use was limited to a very small area around New England. Of course as we all know, Edwin Armstrong's FM technology eventually prevailed and was adopted by thousands of stations around the world.

And it means that we have to talk about the policy at the time it's being enacted.

Australia's housing affordability now shapes the typical housing cycle or housing career as some people call it. Most Australians in the normal course of events are people who move through the housing cycle in a way that matches the stages of life that they're at. So, they move out of the family home in their late teens or early 20s as they gain their independence from their families, then they rent save for a home they can afford as either a group, or maybe a couple. And maybe they can upgrade it when they have a family in their middle age, they are more than likely to have paid off their mortgage. And that means they have housing security in their old age. That's no longer the typical housing cycle for Australians, young people generally live at home for much longer than they once did. They generally rent for longer and they're more likely to be saddled with a mortgage not just into their middle age but more often than not into their retirement as well. In fact, in 2006, 65,000 retiree households were still paying off the mortgage. Affordable rent is also an elusive right around Australia.

Why is it dark in space?That question is not as simple as it may sound. You might think that space appears dark at night because that is when our side of Earth faces away from the Sun as our planet rotates on its axis every 24 hours. But what about all those other far away suns that appear as stars in the night sky? Our own Milky Way galaxy contains over 200 billion stars, and the entire universe probably contains over 100 billion galaxies. You might suppose that that many stars would light up the night like daytime!Until the 20th century, astronomers didn't think it was even possible to count all the stars in the universe. They thought the universe went on forever. In other words, they thought the universe was infinite.Besides being very hard to imagine, the trouble with an infinite universe is that no matter where you look in the night sky, you should see a star. Stars should overlap each other in the sky like tree trunks in the middle of a very thick forest. But, if this were the case, the sky would be blazing with light. This problem greatly troubled astronomers and became known as 'Olbers' Paradox.' A paradox is a statement that seems to disagree with itself.To try to explain the paradox, some 19th century scientists thought that dust clouds between the stars must be absorbing a lot of the starlight so it wouldn't shine through to us. But later scientists realized that the dust itself would absorb so much energy from the starlight that eventually it would glow as hot and bright as the stars themselves.Astronomers now realize that the universe is not infinite. A finite universe—that is, a universe of limited size—even one with trillions and trillions of stars, just wouldn't have enough stars to light up all of space.Although the idea of a finite universe explains why Earth's sky is dark at night, other causes work to make it even darker.","orderId":"RL0394","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604389665893_stdnew.mp3","answer":"At the top, you would have a king.

Curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so because they increase breadth or differentiation in offerings in a way that increases differences in quality. Further, these differences in quality often reflect differences in students' social backgrounds because the 'new' offerings are typically taken up by relatively disadvantaged students who are not served well them. Evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point.The need to Improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries as they seek to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern, knowledge economies. Improved equity is also important for this purpose, since the demand for high—level skills is widespread and the opportunities for the low — skilled are diminishing.Improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion. There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.","orderId":"RL0397","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20211102_1635871256262.mp3","answer":"I believe our borders should be open.

But, for many families, maintaining access to reliable and affordable energy is a persistent challenge and a significant material hardship. This is a problem referred to as energy insecurity, and it affects millions of American households each year. We have found that energy insecurity is a growing and vexing problem among low-income households, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made this problem worse. Our analysis finds that that there are disparities in rates of energy insecurity across various socio-demographic groups. Black and Hispanic households, for example, are significantly more likely to experience energy insecurity and face utility disconnection than white households. So too are households with young children, individuals that require electronic medical devices, and those in dwellings with inefficient or poor conditions. Households that cannot pay for energy are unable to power electronic learning or medical devices, keep perishable, healthy food in the refrigerator, or maintain safe body temperatures. Under conditions of extreme heat or cold, people can suffer from mental and physical health consequences, including the possibility of death. Strategies for coping with uncomfortable temperatures, such as burning trash or sitting in one's car with the heat running, can lead to tragic outcomes as well. Our research underscores the importance of public policy that targets energy insecurity and its underlying causes. Weatherization assistance, incentives for residential solar power, energy bill assistance, and utility disconnection protections are all viable strategies for helping the millions of households across the country that are currently unable to pay their energy bills.","orderId":"RL0399","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604482810884_stdnew.mp3","answer":"The brain is basically built from the bottom up first the brain builds basic circuits that are responsible for basic skills, and then more complex circuits are built on top of those basic circuits as we develop more complex skills.

A similar phenomenon has also occurred in other parts of the animal kingdom. The African grass mouse is a good example. Most mice are nocturnal, but the African grass mouse is active during daylight hours. This means that it spends its days searching for food in the semidry bush and scrub habitats of eastern and southern Africa. Its fur is striped, like a chipmunk's, which helps it blend in with its environment. Because it spends a lot of time in the intense tropical sun, the grass mouse has also evolved two separate safeguards against the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. First, like the populations of humans in this region of the world, the skin of the grass mouse contains lots of melanin, or dark pigment. Second, and quite unusual, this mouse has a layer of melanin-pigmented tissue between its skull and skin. This unique 'cap' provides an extra measure of protection for the grass mouse and three other types of African mouse-like rodents that are active during the day. The only other species scientists have identified with the same sort of skull adaptation is the white tent- making bat of the Central American tropics.

In this developmental game, new neural connections form in the brain as young children instinctively serve through babbling, facial expressions, and gestures, and adults return the serve, responding in a very directed, meaningful way. It starts very early in life when a baby coos and the adults interacts and directs the baby's attention to a face or hand. This interaction forms the foundation of brain architecture upon which all future development will be built. It helps create neural connections between all the different areas of the brain, building the emotional and cognitive skills children need in life. For example, here's how it works for literacy and language skills. When the baby sees an object, the adult says its name. This makes connections in the baby's brain between particular sounds and their corresponding objects. Later, adults show young children that those objects and sounds can also be represented by marks on a page. With continued support from adults, children then learn how to decipher writing and, eventually, to write themselves. Each stage builds on what came before. Ensuring that children have adult caregivers who consistently engage in serve and return interaction, beginning in infancy, builds the foundation in the brain for all the learning, behavior, and health that follow.","orderId":"RL0403","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1600176582696_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Honey bees do a waggle dance to direct other bees to sources of nectar.

Leaders can mobilize people’s energies in ways that range from subtle, quiet persuasion to the coercive threat or the use of deadly force. Sometimes a charismatic leader such as Martin Luther King Jr. can define goals and mobilize energies through rhetoric and the power of example. We can think of leadership as a spectrum, in terms of both visibility and the power the leader wields. On one end of the spectrum, we have the most visible: authoritative leaders like the president of the United States or the prime minister of the United Kingdom, or a dictator such as Hitler or Qaddafi. At the opposite end of the spectrum is casual, low-key leadership found in countless situations every day around the world, leadership that can make a significant difference to the individuals whose lives are touched by it.

Look at their striking colors, often yellow with black stripes or deep blue with black spots. Beyond being nice to look at, these markings have a purpose. They warn predators that these frogs are poisonous. When threatened, these frogs secrete a substance through their skin that would easily kill whatever animal might try to eat them. Their bright colors communicate this, and so most animals tend not to hunt them. Now, speaking of hunting, for centuries these frogs were sought after by hunters.

With this type of structure, you'd pay your sales people a straight albeit competitive salary like all of your other employees, and nothing else. No bonuses, no commissions, and few, if any, sales incentives. This type of compensation plan is most often used when the industry you operate within prohibits direct sales, when sales people work as part of small groups or teams and all contributions are equal, when your sales team is relatively small, or when your sales people are expected to spend much of their time on other responsibilities other than selling. However, these plans don't tend to offer motivation to sales people, as there are no incentives for them to work harder.  Salary plus commission sales compensation plans are possibly the most common plans used today. They're structured in a way that sales people receive a lower base salary along with commission pay that makes up the majority of the total compensation. Organizations use salary plus commission sales compensation plans when there are opportunities to support all sales people on this structure and when there are proper metrics in place for tracking sales to ensure that the splits are fair and accurate. This type of plan is often the better choice as opposed to straight salary because it offers motivation to increase productivity and to achieve goals. It also offers more stability. Sales people will still get some types of pay even if they're in training, when sales are low during certain months, or if market conditions get volatile. However, it can be more complex to administer.  Commission only sales compensation plans are exactly what they sound like you pay your sales people for the sales they bring in and nothing else. There is no guarantee of income. These types of plans are easier to administer than salary plus commission and provide better value for your money paid as they are based solely on sales achieved. They also tend to attract fewer candidates, but do attract the most top-performing and hardest working sales professionals who know they can make a good income because they know how to sell.

And as it does, springtime phenomena—like the first bloom of flowers—are getting earlier and earlier. But rising temperatures aren't the only factor. Urban light pollution is also quickening the coming of spring. 'So temperature and light are really contributing to a double whammy of making everything earlier.' Richard ffrench-Constant, an entomologist at the University of Exeter. He and his colleagues compiled 13 years of data from citizen scientists in the U.K., who tracked the first bud burst of four common trees. Turns out, light pollution—from streetlights in cities, and along roads—pushed bud burst a full week earlier. Way beyond what rising temperatures could achieve. This disruptive timing can ripple through the ecosystem. 'The caterpillars that feed on trees are trying to match the hatching of their eggs to the timing of bud burst. Because the caterpillars want to feed on the juiciest and least chemically protected leaves. And it's not just the caterpillars, of course, that are important. But the knock-on effect is on nesting birds, which are also trying to hatch their chicks at the same time that there's the maximum number of caterpillars.' So earlier buds could ultimately affect the survival of birds, and beyond. The findings are in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The world's becoming increasingly urbanized, and light pollution is growing—which ffrench-Constant says could trick trees into budding earlier and earlier. But smarter lighting—like LEDs that dial down certain wavelengths—could help. 'Perhaps the exciting thing is, if we understand more about how light affects this bud burst, we might be able to devise smarter sort of street lighting that has less red components, and therefore less early bud burst.'

Deaccessing - or selling off - works of art has taken on new importance because of the museum's space problems. And increasingly, curators have been forced to juggle gallery space, rotating one masterpiece into public view while another is sent to storage.

There is another force that we're very familiar with, which is the electromagnetic force, that is the force that is responsible for the electricity, electric currents for light, for the sun's light, that's electromagnetic radiation coming from the Sun to the Earth. There are two other forces though, that are somewhat less familiar, they are the nuclear forces. They are forces that are at work within the nuclear atoms. One of those forces is called the strong nuclear force, that really is the force that bides protons to proton, bides the corks inside of the protons and neutrons keeping them from flying out. The other nuclear force is called the weak nuclear force. And that's a force that predominantly we know of because it's responsible for radio activity, radioactive decay.

About a decade ago, statistician Persi Diaconis started to wonder if the outcome of a coin flip really is just a matter of chance. He had Harvard University engineers build him a mechanical coin flipper. Diaconis, now at Stanford University, found that if a coin is launched exactly the same way, it lands exactly the same way. The randomness in a coin toss, it appears, is introduced by sloppy humans. Each human-generated flip has a different height and speed, and is caught at a different angle, giving different outcomes. But using high speed cameras and equations, Diaconis and colleagues have now found that even though humans are largely unpredictable coin flippers, there's still a bias built in, if a coin starts out heads, it ends up heads when caught more often than it does tails.

Are such stories true? There are many anecdotes supporting the idea, but we’re going to take a fact-based look at whether or not it truly is possible for an adrenalin-charged person to temporarily gain massive strength. In proper terminology, such a temporary boost of physical power would be called hysterical strength. The stories are almost always in the form of one person lifting a car off of another. In each of these cases, some aspect of leverage or buoyancy probably played some role in reducing the magnitude of the feat to something more believable. And even lifting many cars by several inches still leaves most of its weight supported by the suspension springs. But our purpose today is not to 'debunk' any of the specific stories. The majority of them are anecdotal, and interestingly not repeatable; in many cases, the person who summoned the superstrength later tried it again only to find that they couldn’t do it. Basically, what we have is a respectably large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests that in times of crisis, danger, or fear, some people have the ability to temporarily exercise superhuman strength.","orderId":"RL0425","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE1604562007435_stdnew.mp3","answer":"So the way a mother rat takes care of its pups is by licking and grooming, nipple switching an arch back nursing.

So you put the high lickers in one cage not the mothers, but the offspring and the low lickers in another cage and then you let them grow and they're adults now, their mothers are long buried and you look in the brain and you see that those who had high licking mothers express a lot of glucocorticoid receptor, gene and though so our lawmakers express know that reflects a number of factors and that results in a different stress response, but this is not the only difference.

Gehry. Now, I'm not going to go into his career in detail; it is enough to say that early on he was, like other modernist architects, tied to the rectangle, the straight line, and so on.  Often their buildings would have this basic shape and they would just, urn…, add bits of decoration like splashes of color or pointless balconies. Soon enough, Gehry wanted to break away from straight lines and grid like designs. He wanted the freedom to experiment with other shapes, curves and unusually-angled roofs. What helped him with this was the computer, which allowed him to visualize and experiment with complex shapes, and to work on the whole design as one piece, without the added decoration being thrown in as an afterthought.

It is part of that process that you come out as a world authority on your chosen subject.

Actually, a woman in the class I'm teaching at Sydney at the moment, a career woman, expressed this very nicely, although she was talking about something else, she was distinguishing expertise from authority. And certainly linguists, because of our training we do, have expertise in certain very narrow areas of language, but we don't have the authority over what to do with that knowledge or what to do with other knowledge that the community produces. I guess for me the bottom line is languages are lost because of the dominance of one people over another. That's not rocket science, it's not hard to work that out.

Kinetics deals with the actions of forces that cause various motions (also known as dynamics) and it is concerned with the rate of reactions. Temperature is the average kinetic energy within a given object. Thermal energy is defined as the total of all kinetic energies within a given system. It is important to remember that heat is caused by flow of thermal energy due to differences in temperature (heat flows from object at higher temperature to object at lower temperature), transferred through conduction/convection/radiation. Additionally thermal energy always flows from warmer areas to cooler areas. Energy occurs in many forms, including chemical energy, thermal energy, electromagnetic radiation, gravitational energy, electric energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, and rest energy. These can be categorized in two main classes: potential energy and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy. Kinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a cyclist uses chemical energy provided by food to accelerate a bicycle to a chosen speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome air resistance and friction. The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces heat within the cyclist.","orderId":"RL0429","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20220608_1654701264458.mp3","answer":"To be a successful entrepreneur, you should have good ideas, but the definition of a good idea varies depending on whom you ask.

In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements.[1][2][3] Very few foods contain vitamin D; synthesis of vitamin D (specifically cholecalciferol) in the skin is the major natural source of the vitamin. Dermal synthesis of vitamin D from cholesterol is dependent on sun exposure Vitamin D from the diet or dermal synthesis from sunlight is biologically inactive; activation requires enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) in the liver and kidney.Evidence indicates the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure is regulated by a negative feedback loop that prevents toxicity, but because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine (US), for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements. Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intake for vitamin D assumes no synthesis occurs and all of a person's vitamin D is from food intake, although that will rarely occur in practice. As vitamin D is synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight[citation needed], it is not strictly a vitamin, and may be considered a hormone as its synthesis and activity occur in different locations. Vitamin D has a significant role in calcium homeostasis and metabolism.

Fleas and the plague, atoms and nuclear bombs. Diminutive leaders in world history. Soot is one of these little things. Soot also known as black carbon is released when you burn dung, coal, diesel fuel and wood. From Los Angeles to Mumbai, soot causes respiratory illnesses like lung cancer and asthma and contributes to one point six million premature deaths every year. Mostly among the poor. And it gets worse. Atmospheric currents carry soot thousands of miles from where it is produced, to the Himalayas and the Arctic. Black carbon being black, absorbs sunlight, so even a little soot on snow makes it melt faster. And when snow melts global sea levels rise, threatening our freshwater indigenous communities and polar bears who hunt on the Arctic ice. Climate Change has been a big thing for a while and carbon dioxide has been its main cause. Scientists estimate that soot causes twenty five percent of human-caused global warming. It’s the second leading cause of Arctic warming after carbon dioxide. Let’s not underestimate the impact of this tiny particle. But there’s good news, reducing black carbon may be the fastest way to slow global warming. Buy time for the Arctic. Yes even more so than changing a light bulb. Since black carbon only stays in the atmosphere for a couple of weeks, reducing it will produce results immediately. Of course, reducing soot alone won’t solve global warming, but solving our soot problem now will help buy time for the Arctic and allow us to deal with the bigger problem of carbon dioxide. We have the cleaner industries, cook stoves, and diesel now we have to use them. In developed nations, we’ve significantly reduced our black carbon, but we still have much more to do. We need to tighten our standards at home and invest in cleaner technologies in developing nations. In a world going on seven billion people, you might feel rather little yourself.

Instead, take a closer look. New research shows that overqualified workers tend to perform better than other employees, and they don't quit any sooner. Furthermore, a simple managerial tactic—empowerment—can mitigate any dissatisfaction they may feel.The prejudice against too-good employees is pervasive. Companies tend to prefer an applicant who is a 'perfect fit' over someone who brings more intelligence, education, or experience than needed. On the surface, this bias makes sense: Studies have consistently shown that employees who consider themselves overqualified exhibit higher levels of discontent. For example, overqualification correlated well with job dissatisfaction in a 2008 study of 156 call-center reps by Israeli researchers Saul Fine and Baruch Nevo. And unlike discrimination based on age or gender, declining to hire overqualified workers is perfectly legal.But even before the economic downturn, a surplus of overqualified candidates was a global problem, particularly in developing economies, where rising education levels are giving workers more skills than are needed to supply the growing service sectors. If managers can get beyond the conventional wisdom, the growing pool of too-good applicants is a great opportunity. Berrin Erdogan and Talya N. Bauer of Portland State University in Oregon found that overqualified workers' feelings of dissatisfaction can be dissipated by giving them autonomy in decision making. At stores where employees didn't feel empowered, 'overeducated' workers expressed greater dissatisfaction than their colleagues did and were more likely to state an intention to quit. But that difference vanished where self-reported autonomy was high.","orderId":"RL0436","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1683546302767.mp3","answer":"Science lets us know what is going on.

Nevertheless, it has been said that today children interrupt their education to go to school. The distinction between schooling and education implied by this remark is important. Education is much more open-ended and all-inclusive than schooling. Education knows no bounds. It can take place anywhere, whether in the shower or in the job, whether in a kitchen or on a tractor. It includes both the formal learning that takes place in schools and the whole universe of informal learning. The agents of education can range from a revered grandparent to the people debating politics on the radio, from a child to a distinguished scientist. Whereas schooling has a certain predictability, education quite often produces surprises. A chance conversation with a stranger may lead a person to discover how little is known of other religions. People are engaged in education from infancy on. Education, then, is a very broad, inclusive term. It is a lifelong process, a process that starts long before the start of school, and one that should be an integral part of one's entire life. Schooling, on the other hand, is a specific, formalized process, whose general pattern varies little from one setting to the next. Throughout a country, children arrive at school at approximately the same time, take assigned seats, are taught by an adult, use similar textbooks, do homework, take exams, and so on. The slices of reality that are to be learned, whether they are the alphabet or an understanding of the working of government, have usually been limited by the boundaries of the subject being taught.

Today, our master thatchers will begin giving this barn behind me a sturdy thatched roof, able to withstand heavy winds and last up to a hundred years. How do they do it? Well, in a nutshell, thatching involves covering the beams or rafters, the wooden skeleton of a roof with reeds or straw. Our thatchers here have harvested their own natural materials for the job, the bundles of water reeds you see lying over there beside the barn. Thatching is certainly uncommon in the Untied States today. I guess that's why so many of you have come to see this demonstration. But it wasn't always that way. In the seventeenth century, the colonists here thatched their roofs with reeds and straw, just as they had done in England. After a while, though, they began to replace the thatch with wooden shingles because wood was so plentiful. And eventually, other roofing materials like stone, slate, and clay tiles came into use. It's a real shame that most people today don't realize how strong and long lasting a thatched roof is. In Ireland, where thatching is still practiced, the roofs can survive winds of up to one hundred ten miles per hour. That's because straw and reeds are so flexible. They bend but don't break in the wind like other materials can. Another advantage is that the roofs keep the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter. And then, of course, there's the roofs' longevity—the average is sixty years, but they can last up to a hundred.

We call it as the darkness hormone. In every species that we studied, melatonin occurs at night. And it's hormone that prepares you for the things, that your species, does at night. So, of course, in humans we sleep, but animals, like rodents, they are awake. So, it's a hormone that is related to darkness behavior.","orderId":"RL0444","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1690975475078.mp3","answer":"Why is it difficult to make a robot like a human being? Why cannot robots finish the work easily like human beings? For some tasks, it is easy and simple for humans to complete, but it is very difficult to ask a robot to do what we want because humans and robots have different recognition functions. For example, considering the insights, it is hard for robots to recognize colours because they do not have sensory mechanisms. Artificial intelligence scientists have to devise a sensor that is implanted to robots to enable them to recognize different colours. The sensor has a camera on it to capture pixels, and then will translate the pixels into an image, which is not as easy as expected. This process is very complex. The translation of every pixel to accurate things could be difficult, especially colour differentiation which needs complicated sensories to fulfil. So the improvement of the sensor is necessary. In conclusion, there is no comparison between humans and robots.","orderId":"RL0445","repeated":false,"difficulty":"easy"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1690975877885.mp3","answer":"'I suppose more and more, people are starting to see graffiti as a form of art. Now there are still many who would beg to differ - and they'd point to the destructive scribblings that we see on our bus shelters and our public buildings. These often take the form of tags which are fancy, scribble-like versions of someone's name or nick-name. Tags generally have no aesthetic appeal and they are the scourge of the high street shopkeeper in many a town. I can certainly see where the shopkeepers and property owners are coming from. But the fact is, graffiti has been around for a very long time indeed. People left their mark on cave walls back in prehistoric times and it's been found too on ancient monuments in Egypt and Rome. But New York style graffiti - which is really the forerunner of a lot of the graffiti that's getting done now - New York graffiti took off in the late 1960s. That's when the advent of the spraycan allowed the humble tag to evolve into more complex styles. In the mid to late 70s, subway trains became the new forum for graffiti artists to display their skills. For many young people it became a medium to express their disillusionment with a system from which they felt excluded. Now of course, the art establishment embraces graffiti artists and some of these artists have actually taken on cult status.

You see Einstein taught us in general activity that space and time are not in an inert backdrop. They participate in an unfolding of the cosmos space and time can warp and curve that creates the force of gravity. When you recognize that space and time are dynamic, they can change that they're real physical entities. Well, they must be subject to the laws of quantum physics. And the key element of quantum physics it's relevant is the uncertainty principle. When applying to the space and time, it's a space and time are uncertain which means they can wildly fluctuate. They can in a sense look like the violently boiling surface of a pot of water. When you examine space and time and fantastically small scales. So the idea is that if you examine space in small and small scales, not everyday scales, but tiny scales the uncertainty gets bigger and bigger and space and time became foam-like. They look bubbly. They look phonetic undulating. That's quantum foam down of the ultra microscopic scale that we've been struggling to deal with for decades because the math Einstein doesn't work down there. The math quantum mechanics and the math Einstein lock horns, we've been trying to resolve that conflict in the essence to understand what truly is going on with the quantum foam.","orderId":"RL0447","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1694094895073.mp3","answer":"Current studies show that what goes on labels is an important consideration for manufacturers, since more than seventy percent of shoppers read food labels when considering whether to buy a product. A recent controversy as to whether labels on prepared foods should educate or merely inform the consumer is over, and a consumer group got its way. The group had maintained that product labels should do more than simply list how many grams of nutrients a food contains. Their contention was that labels should also list the percentage of a day's total nutrients that the product will supply to the consumer, because this information is essential in planning a healthy diet. A government agency disagreed strongly, favoring a label that merely informs the consumer, in other words, a label that only lists the contents of the products. The agency maintained that consumers could decide for themselves if the food is nutritious and is meeting their daily needs. The consumer group, in supporting its case, had cited a survey in which shoppers were shown a food label, and were then asked if they would need more or less of a certain nutrient after eating a serving of this product. The shoppers weren't able to answer the questions easily when they were not given a specific percentage. This study, and others helped get the new regulation passed, and now food products must have the more detailed labels.","orderId":"RL0448","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1694094958651.mp3","answer":"What I want to look at today is the question of how much technology - If, um, a pen can indeed be called technology ... perhaps I should say the instrument of writing - affects a writer's style and level of production. I also want to consider other factors that may have an effect on prose style, such as personality, educational background, and so on. Now, production levels aren't so hard to measure in relation to the writing instrument used. The quill pen, for instance, would need continual re-filling and resharpening, which led to a leisurely, balanced style of prose full of simple sentences. Writing took a lot longer than now and the great novelists of the 18' century - Fielding, Smollett, Richardson - had a relatively small output, though some of their books ran to enormous length. By the middle of the 19'h century, the fountain pen had been invented. It didn't need such constant refilling, which can account for the more flowing, discursive style of, say, Dickens and Thackeray, as well as their tremendous output. Then came the typewriter, whose purpose, once you got the hang of it, was to speed up the writing process and was therefore much favored by journalists. This, it seems to me, gave rise to a short winded style characterized by short sentences. A short prose style, if you like. Dictating machines and tape recorders led, as one novelist complained, to writers becoming too conversational, rambling and long winded. Henry James, although he didn't use these machines, dicta ted his later novels and, well, some might agree with this accusation. Well, it looks as though we're going to have to leave word processors, computers and, of course, the way film and its narrative techniques have affected writing style for another day.","orderId":"RL0449","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/SPEAKING_RETELL_LECTURE_1696773498082.mp3","answer":"I’m 43 years old, and I owe tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.

Fifteen years later, I still experience moments of sheer horror regarding my family's financial situation. My monthly student loan payment is more than triple my car payment. OK, so without my college degree, I would not have been able to get my current job. For that I'm grateful but at what cost?

I'm being kept in class a financial class of graduates whose only hope for attending college meant borrowing money from the government.
