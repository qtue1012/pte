We often talk about the knowledge about the literature in poem. Poetry is probably the oldest form of literature, and probably predates the origin of writing itself. The oldest written manuscripts we have are poems, mostly epic poems telling the stories of ancient mythology. The English language in poems and poetries is difficult to understand, often giving readers a feeling of frustration and making it hard for readers to enjoy poetry. This is because poems use literary expressions. Poetry was once written according to fairly strict rules of meter and rhyme, and each culture had its own rules. Some poems incorporate rhyme schemes, with two or more lines that end in like-sounding words.

You might not normally think of frogs as being colorful, but these frogs definitely are. They are the dart-poison frogs of Central and South America. Look at their striking colors, often yellow with black stripes or deep blue with black spots. Beyond being nice to look at, these markings have a purpose. They warn predators that these frogs are poisonous. When threatened, these frogs secrete a substance through their skin that would easily kill whatever animal might try to eat them. Their bright colors communicate this, and so most animals tend not to hunt them. Now, speaking of hunting, for centuries these frogs were sought after by hunters. As you might think, the hunters didn't want to eat the frogs, but rather, they captured them for their poison. They would add the poison to the tips of their hunting arrows. Of course, nowadays most hunters use guns. These days, dart-poison frogs are of less interest to hunters than to medical researchers. Researchers believe that they can make new heart medicine from the poison, because it acts as a stimulant on the body's nervous system. Researchers think they could use it to stimulate a weak heart. There is, however, a problem with doing research on these frogs. Those that are caught in the wild will produce their poison until they die. However, those that are born in captivity, like the ones you see here, will not produce any poison at all.","orderId":"SST0007","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT1606976198647_stdnew.mp3","answer":"The nature of the business entity is to exchange something you have for something you desire.

Many of us would prefer to focus on our logical thinking nature and ignore our sometimes troublesome emotions, but emotions have a purpose. Our most basic emotions like fear, anger or disgust are vital messengers: they evolved as signals to help us meet our basic needs for self-preservation and safety. It would be dangerous to be indecisive about a threat to our survival so the brain runs information from our senses through the most primitive, reactive parts of our brain first.  These areas of the brain control instinctive responses and they don’t do too much thinking.

Consumers collectively throw away more than all the retailers together in the US. In total, private US households waste around 43% of all food. According to 'Save the Food', a national public service campaign, this could translate into an annual financial loss of $1,500 for a family of four. In fact, over 40 million tons (36 million tonnes) of food ends up in landfills every year, worth more than $161 billion. 60% of food waste comes from general consumption. There are two main sources of food waste. The majority of food waste comes from supermarkets, especially in the used-by section. The other factor is what people purchase and how they eat, so purchasing all items is not a good idea.

Thirdly, it is essential for great ideas to be transformative and productive. All ideas are essentially a combination of other smaller ideas, but this doesn’t mean they can’t be unique. Merely copying doesn’t make anything idiosyncratic, it’s the individuality that one puts in which makes a concept stand out. Constant innovation leaves no room for stagnation and thus, adds on to the basic idea, effectively making it unique.

But British computer scientist Alan Turing decided to disregard all these questions. In favor of a much simpler one: can a computer talk like a human? This question led to an idea for measuring artificial intelligence that would famously come to be known as the Turing test. In the 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation with unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must be able to replace one of the players without substantially changing the results. In other words, a computer would be considered intelligent if its conversation couldn’t be easily distinguished from a human’s.

The majority of sleep-clinic patients suffer from disorders of excessive sleep, or 'hypersomnia.' While most insomniacs somehow manage to drag themselves through the day and function at acceptable, although not optimal levels, this is not so for people who suffer from hypersomnia. They are incapacitated by irresistible urges to sleep during the day, often in inappropriate situations--at business meetings, in supermarkets, or at parties. Even more dangerous is their failure to remain awake when driving or operating machinery. Falling asleep in such situations could obviously be life-threatening. Many hypersomniacs suffer from narcolepsy, for which the primary symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness. Though not apparent in childhood, this symptom most often appears for the first time during the teen years and continues throughout a person's life.

The outcomes involve parents, friends, schools and siblings, and researchers figure out which factors are essential and more important than others. Successful schools depend on the resources and support of their communities and schools at the centre of their communities are often the most successful schools. In turn, schools are vital to the social health of their local communities. Also, families are the first social unit in which children learn and develop. Good parenting can take different forms and be shaped by various social and cultural forces, but it invariably involves providing children with the support, care, love, guidance and protection that set the conditions for healthy physical, mental and social development.

I'm going to start with vitamin D and I think probably most of you know that vitamin D is called the sunshine vitamin and it's called that because there's absolutely no dietary need for vitamin D if you get adequate sunshine and the real important word there is it because it turns out that in climates which aren't near the equator there's a big question as to whether or not using these you get adequate sunshine and that's important because foods are not naturally abundant in vitamin D and that's why milk is fortified but the fortification may not be enough so again just exposure to sunlight is adequate no need for vitamin D so vitamin D really isn't the vitamin. It's a pro-hormone. When human beings evolve we evolved in tropical climates and ran around naked.

So if you're reading Shakespeare or listening to Shakespeare, you're listening to somebody whose language is not quite the language of our current, of our current. You're listening to someone who was writing in a language which is a bit out of date for now. It needs a little bit of effort to understand that language, but the understanding will be done partly for you by the actors, if you're hearing it, or if you're seeing it performed.  Another thing is that Shakespeare was a very great poet. He wrote poems are at narrative poems and sonnets. But he was also, and this is my third point, he was also a great theatre poet. His poetry is dramatic poetry in the plays, he's not just writing static poetry, lyric poetry in the plays, which is therefore declamation.

It refers to the invisible barrier that seems to exist in many fields and which prevents women from achieving senior positions. Less well-known, but arguably a more pernicious problem, is the 'glass cliff'. Originally recognised by academics Michelle Ryan and Alex Haslam back in 2005, this is the phenomenon of women making it to the boardroom but finding themselves disproportionately represented in untenable leadership positions. Ryan and Haslam presented evidence that women were indeed starting to secure seats at boardroom tables. But the problem was that their positions were inherently unstable. These women would then find themselves in an unsustainable leadership position from which they would be ousted with evidence of apparent failure. The title of their paper sums it up: women are over‐represented in precarious leadership positions. Subsequent research in an array of environments has demonstrated that this is not an isolated issue, nor is it unique to certain industries or geographical locations. It reveals that women in top leadership positions seem to be routinely handed inherently unsolvable problems.","orderId":"SST0039","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20211027_1635348503583.mp3","answer":"So there are two theories for how the gas giants formed.

It’s not that the gas giants also have a metallic core, but maybe a metallic core not made of iron. Hydrogen, for example, becomes metallic at a certain pressure. So it’s very possible that the insides of these planets could have metallic cores, could have hydrogen cores, could have rocky portions we’re not sure.

Specifically, if the goal of a meeting is to brainstorm or solve a problem, silent meetings have been shown to generate better ideas. But why? Solutions to a problem will often be a novel idea and novel ideas challenge convention. They can rock the boat and make people feel uncomfortable. But when participants gather around a table and generate written solutions in silence, a safe space is created. Novel ideas can emerge and people are less afraid of feeling embarrassed. Silent meetings also circumvent negative effects of something called production blocking. In a conventional meeting, only one person at a time can speak. As you wait your turn, the conversation may shift and you may lose your opportunity to raise an idea. Silent meetings allow for everyone to express ideas simultaneously. So how do you create a silent brainstorming meeting? Have people write down their ideas independently then sort them into clusters, discuss, and vote on the ideas that people like. The key is to let the initial ideation phase happen independently and in silence so we can separate egos from ideas. Silence is just one alternative.

Yesterday, I told you that we were going to start looking at a field of psychology called developmental psychology. This branch of psychology looks at the many ways people's minds and bodies develop from before they're even born until they die. So we should just start at the beginning. I think. Let's start with infants. So, when a baby is born up until he or she starts talking, the baby is referred to as an infant. Infants can't do a lot of things that older children can do. Let's look at the physical side of things. Babies are born with really poor vision. Actually, they're legally blind when born. Infants can mostly make out large shapes and stuff, but they can't tell detail. Also, their sense of color isn't very good. For a long time, psychologists thought infants were colorblind right after birth. As it turns out, research has shown that most babies can, in fact, make out bright colors. For example, an infant can tell the difference between a bright red ball and a bright blue ball. But it would be much harder for an infant to tell the difference between a light blue ball and a dark blue ball. Anyway, as infants get older, their sense of sight improves. Some psychologists think that by the age of six months, an infant's vision will be almost the same as an adult's.","orderId":"SST0050","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20220311_1646989585954.mp3","answer":"I understand that one major concern of yours in running a successful company, especially in the current economic climate, is the question of worker loyalty. Are you saying that such a thing no longer exists and, if so, what are some of the reasons for this, and how important is loyalty to the smooth and successful running of a company such as yours? Well, I do think it's important, but I also realize that we can't go back to the old-fashioned sense of loyalty where an employee would spend his whole working life with one company or business. Our grandparents', even our parents', generation expected long-term employment, and their loyalty was rewarded with health care and a pension. This is no longer the case. Many companies are no longer willing, or perhaps even able, to provide such a financial package. Besides, to a younger generation, sticking at the same job all your life isn't a very exciting or inspiring prospect. Some reasons for this might be the shortening of contracts, outsourcing, automation, and people holding down more than one job. In other words, we've all had to adapt to the realities of a rapidly changing, fast-paced economy. However, all this is not to say that loyalty is dead, rather it has changed emphasis. Today, it is more about trust, and that employee will promise to bring his skills and engage full in his work for as long as she or he is there.

It is also important for individuals to have 'empathy' as it allows them to respond in an understanding and caring way to how others are feeling. Children are facing social difficulties with particular risks. Young people who do not have strong relationships with the adults in their family are even more at risk.

At various times a soldier, journalist, author, and politician, Churchill is generally regarded as one of the most important leaders in British and world history. Considered reactionary on some issues, such as granting independence to Britain's colonies and at times regarded as a self--promoter who changed political parties to further his career, it was his wartime leadership that earned him iconic status. Some of his peacetime decisions, such as restoring the Gold Standard in 1924, were disastrous as was his World War I decision to land troops on the Dardanelles. However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler's Nazi Germany in the free world, his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people during their darkest hour.Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny, and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny. Indeed, he believed that God had placed him on earth to carry out heroic deeds for the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. A providential under standing of history would concur with Churchill's self--understanding. Considered old--fashioned, even reactionary by some people today, he was actually a visionary whose dream was of a united world, beginning with a union of the English--speaking peoples, then embracing all cultures. In his youth, he cut a dashing figure as a cavalry officer as seen in the 1972 film Young Winston (directed by Richard Attenborough), but the images of him that are the most widely remembered are as a rather overweight, determined, even pugnacious looking senior statesman as he is depicted to the right.","orderId":"SST0055","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20220807_1659859248799.mp3","answer":"We have briefly looked at some of the problems involved in running a biggish city like, say, Melbourne, keeping the road and rail systems running, policing, providing food and housing, and so on.

However, first I want to go back in history to when the population of cities could be numbered in the thousands rather than millions. One of the earliest theorists of the city was, of course, Plato, who created an ideal city in his text, The Republic. The population of this city would be around twenty-five to thirty thousand at most. Oddly enough, the same figures were chosen by Leonardo da Vinci for his ideal cities. Now, of these twenty five to thirty thousand inhabitants only about five thousand would be citizens. A reason for this might be that it is the largest number that could be addressed publicly at one time and by one person, and makes a voting system much easier to manage.

It is very unfortunate that many of the Native Americans are living under poor conditions throughout the country.

The rocks propagate out from that point on the rupture to cover the entire fault plane. The rupture is in that particular earthquake. We talked about the epicenter of the earthquake a lot.

Now there has been some disagreement regarding the extent to which human activity can be blamed for climate change but I want to argue that there is evidence which clearly demonstrates that our own actions really are causing a genuine threat. The available evidence seems to indicate fairly conclusively that land and sea temperatures started to increase around 200 years ago. So, what's the significance of this! Well, 200 years ago roughly coincides with the beginning of the industrial revolution in the northern hemisphere. In other words, this was when our production of harmful gases really got going as a result of increased industrialization. Since that time our production of gases has accelerated due to the fact that not only has industry grown in size but it has also now spread to the southern hemisphere, indeed, most parts of the world.

A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things.

Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.

In fact, a typical astronomer spends most of his or her time analyzing data and may only be at the telescope a few weeks of the year. Some astronomers work on purely theoretical problems and never use a telescope at all. You might not know how rarely images are viewed directly through telescopes. The most common way to observe the skies is to photograph them. The process is very simple. First, a photographic plate is coated with a light-sensitive material. The plate is positioned so that the image received by the telescope is recorded on it. Then the image can be developed, enlarged, and published so that many people can study it. Because most astronomical objects are very remote, the light we receive from them is rather feeble. But by using a telescope as a camera, long time exposures can be made.

The resolution of the telescope is a measure of how sharply defined the details of the image can be. The telescope’s primary mirror may have a fraction. As a result, starlight is not brought to a focus at the same point, resulting in blurry images. The name ’telescope‘ covers a wide range of instruments. There are major differences in how astronomers must go about collecting light in different frequency bands.

Light-gathering power of a telescope is proportional to the area of its aperture and hence depends on the square of the radius of the mirror. Therefore, a 20 cm diameter telescope collects four times more photons than a 10 cm diameter telescope. A telescope can be equipped to record light over a long period of time, by using photographic film or electronic detectors such as photometers or CCD detectors while the eye has no capability to store light. Along-exposure photograph taken through a telescope reveals objects too faint to be seen with the eye, even by looking through the same telescope.  A third major advantage of large telescopes is that they have superior resolution, the ability to discern fine detail. Small resolution is good.

All languages of the world, natural languages at least, have words for eye and head and nose and ear and for sky and earth and for water, sand and for sibling, mother and father. They may not have words for uncle and aunt. It becomes much vaguer because in one culture an aunt is different when it comes from your father's side than from your mother's side. You don't include snow. Most people know what snow is but in the tropics you don't have it. So you look for notions that are totally comparable and that occur everywhere in the world. You can the hundred or two hundred most universal notions in a human life, those which you call the basic vocabulary.  So you take basic vocabularies and languages that you think are related. You look for words that sound the same and basically you're not fooled by a hundred per cent identical words but you are really looking for words, while they are different in one language from the other, the sounds correspond but every sound has to correspond to maybe a totally different sound in the other language that you compare it with.

Small businesses have gone from being traditional small-town stores selling food or clothing to sophisticated, high-tech enterprises.

It's important for management to keep in mind which of the customers' needs the business serves, because it can't serve all their needs. Writing a business plan that everyone in the organization understands and follows will help to provide the necessary focus and direction. It's important to state clearly what the purpose of the business is. Additionally, each person within the organization must know what tasks to perform in order to fulfill that purpose. Now, if for some reason a business plan doesn't work, try hard to discover why not, rewrite it, and immediately focus on the new plan. A work of caution, however, never give up a bad plan without replacing it. A business has to have a plan because it can't afford to waste its limited resources.

Keep in mind that most animals can only repeat their limited utterances over and over again, while humans can say things that have never been said before. Today I want to focus on human language and how it developed. I doubt you'll be surprised when I say that the evolution of language was slow and laborious. There's some reliable evidence that language began with early humans a million and a half years ago. Through the study of the size and shape of brain fossils, scientists have determined that early human brains, like modern brains, had a left hemisphere slightly larger than the right hemisphere. We know that in modern humans, the left hemisphere's the seat of language. We also know that early human brains had a well-developed frontal section, known as Broca's area, which coordinates the muscles of the mouth and throat. It's clear, then, that early humans had a speech apparatus. They could produce any sound that we can. What we don't know is whether early humans used what they had.

A four to six-year-old child sits alone in a room at a table facing a marshmallow on a plate. The child is told: 'If you don't eat this treat for 15 minutes you can have both it and a second one. Kids on average wait for five or six minutes before eating the marshmallow. The longer a child can resist the treat has been correlated with higher general competency later in life. Now a study shows that ability to resist temptation isn't strictly innate-it also highly influenced by environment. Researchers gave five-year-old used crayons and one sticker to decorate a sheet of paper. One group was promised a new set of art supplies for the project-but then never received it. But the other group did receive new crayons and better stickers. Then both groups were given the marshmallow test.

An ice core is a continuous section of ice drilled into a glacier or an ice sheet. We're sending this instrument down which is just a cutting tool and the thing goes down a meter at a time. You bring it up and now you have these long tubes of ice. Drilling an ice core is kind of like a time machine. You can go back and find out what was the atmosphere like 50,000 years ago. It's snow that has fallen and then it's compressed trapping the atmosphere.

The report celebrates the success of some schools in implementing the citizenship curriculum. It praises those schools where they have taken and have substantial developments in the subject, and which now go a long way towards fulfilling national curriculum requirements. In the report, we are critical of schools which have not taken citizenship seriously, either through reluctance or lack of capacity to make appropriate provision in the curriculum. Citizenship is marginalized in the curriculum. And in one fifth of schools, it is less well established in the curriculum than other subjects, and less well taught. And some critics have seized on this as a reason for wanting to step back from supporting it. Yet, the progress made to date by the more committed school suggests that the reasons for introducing citizenship are both worthwhile and can be fulfilled, given the time and resources. Indeed, those reasons are given added weight by national and global events of the past few months.

Implicit memory, which is also called procedural memory, cannot be consciously recalled. It is an experimental or functional form of memory, informed by cultural and social background. With implicit memory, behaviors are automatic. We recall implicit memories naturally, so we are not aware when we are using them. Examples of implicit memory include using languages naturally, driving automatically, reading and writing. When people try to consciously describe how to drive, they may misrepresent how they actually drive. What we often describe as ‘bad memory’ is an explicit memory. Explicit memory is also known as episodic memory, which is totally different from implicit memory. It’s more about time and space and is often related to personal life experiences.

So, um — by the 1950s, air pollution was very visible with frequent thick black fogs known as 'smogs' in many large cities around the world. The main source of this pollution was from factories and it caused severe health problems. For example, a particularly severe smog in London in 1952 caused over four thousand deaths. Obviously something had to be done and in 1956 a Clean Air Act was introduced in Britain. This addressed the pollution from factories and the smogs soon disappeared. However, as you know, these days air pollution is still a big issue. The main difference between now and the 1950s is that you can't see it — it's invisible. Also, the main source of pollution now is from cars and lorries, and although these don't produce visible signs, this air pollution is still a significant risk to health. And one of the key factors in the rise of this type of pollution is that we have all become much more vehicle-dependent. There are far more cars and lorries, trains and planes than in the 1950s and this is now the main source of air pollution around the world.","orderId":"SST0104","repeated":true,"difficulty":"easy"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1768813_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Before we consider international environmental law and climate change, we need to consider domestic legislation, as it is within the sovereign states that international law is put into practice. This reflects the environmentalists' maxim, 'think globally act locally'. United Kingdom legislative control over the impacts of mans' activity on the environment is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II, the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of 'sea coal'. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by 'self-regulation' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect.  The next stage was prompted by the Industrial Revolution with the urbanisation of society and its profound effects on the environment. Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximise their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of 'Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good. Those industrialists who were concerned for either the health of their employees or the local environment faced higher costs than their competitors.

We can tether turtles in these little cloth harnesses, put them into this tank and dull swimming place. University of North Carolina biologist Ken Loman studies sea turtles that are programed from birth for an extraordinary journey. Mother turtles buried the eggs on the beach and then returned to the sea and the eggs hatch about 50 to 60 days later. Support for the National Science Foundation, Loman is learning how these reptiles use the Earth’s magnetic field to navigate a 5-to-10-year journey around the Atlantic Ocean. The turtles seem to inherit a set of responses that tell them what to do when they encounter specific magnetic fields at particular locations. This animal magnetism can be a lifesaver and one field off Portugal triggers the turtles to turn south. If they don’t, they likely die, swept into frigid North Atlantic waters. In one lab test turtles responded to magnetic field similarly to what they would encounter off the coast of Florida. The great majority of them turned South East. This is an exciting finding because southeasterly orientation in this part of the world would presumably take turtles further into the Gulfstream. So, the turtles actually have what might be considered accrued global positioning system that is based on the Earth’s magnetic field. And check out this experiment. These turtle moves may look odd. The turtles will actually act out their swimming behavior in air. But this wave simulator re-creates the first environmental cue hatchling turtles respond to.

These nodules are potato-sized rocks containing high levels of metals, including copper, manganese and nickel. They grow very slowly on the sea-bed, over millions of years. Although no commercial operations exist to extract these resources, many are planned. Professor Edward Hill, Executive Director at the NOC commented, 'By 2050 there will be nine billion people on earth and attention is increasingly turning to the ocean, particularly the deep ocean, for food, clean supplies of energy and strategic minerals. The NOC is undertaking research related to many aspects and perspectives involved in exploiting ocean resources. This research is aimed at informing with sound scientific evidence the decisions that will need to be taken in the future, as people increasingly turn to the oceans to address some of society's greatest challenges.'","orderId":"SST0123","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT1602150643631_stdnew.mp3","answer":"The first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present indigenous people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 43,000 years Before Present, while the upper range supported by others is 60,000 to 70,000 years BP. In any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait The ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversify and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10,000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Peninsula. During the 1970s and 1980s around 120,000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration Al Grassby termed 'multiculturalism'. In 2004-05, Australia accepted 123,000 new settlers, a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40,000 in 200405) moved to Sydney. The majority of immigrants came from Asia, led by China and India.","orderId":"SST0124","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20211027_1635353669495.mp3","answer":"I'm fascinated by the extent to which sharing economy platforms like Uber and Airbnb are getting Americans to trust each other again. Over the last 40 years, the level of trust in society has fallen quite dramatically. Less than 1 in 5 Americans under the age of 35 today feel that people are trustworthy in general. But in parallel, we've developed a heightened level of trust in strangers who we meet through a digital interface. There's a generation that has grown up reading Yelp reviews, reading Amazon reviews, making their consumption choices based on what strangers on a digital platform say. And so someone who we interact with who comes accompanied by online reviews, a Facebook and LinkedIn profile, and other digital cues seems to be someone we'll trust at the level of friends and family. What excites me about this transition is that through history every time society has created a new basis for trust, it has expanded the economy dramatically.

The long-legged and speedy Cataglyphis fortis normally covers ground with a three-legged stride that moves two legs forwards on one side, and one on the other. For the next step, the insect mirrors the move with its other three legs. But recordings of ants in the Tunisian desert reveal that when faced with oversized lumps of food 10 times their own weight, the forward “tripod” walking style is abandoned. Unable to lift the morsels in their mandibles, the ants drag the food backwards instead, moving all six legs independently. “This is the first time we have seen this in any ants,” said lead author Sarah Pfeffer at the University of Ulm in Germany. The ants’ long legs already help keep their bodies away from the scorching desert floor and enable them to speed around at up to 60cm per second. “Think of Usain Bolt, who has very long legs compared to body size. The desert floor is also very hot, so the further away their bodies are from the surface, the better,” said co-author Matthias Wittlinger. The ants have also evolved to function at body temperatures of 50C in a desert where temperatures can soar to 70C. “They’re basically just trying to get out of the heat,” he added.","orderId":"SST0126","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20211101_1635775992273.mp3","answer":"A professor’s sociology find out the capacity of well-educated parents will remain in their prosperous children because these children have sufficient educational capacity and support since they are born.

His family moved to America when he was 13 and settled in Pittsburgh. He found jobs working in a fabric mill and telegraph office. Carnegie always did well at whatever he set his mind to. He was known to make improvements to any job he held. While working for the telegraph office, he began studying the railroad system, and he soon became the superintendent. He took the money he had saved and invested in an oil company. His investment return was good and then he went to England to learn how to make steel. He wanted to make steel that was cheaper and more durable than American steel. He came back with his knowledge and built a huge steel factory. Carnegie's Factory was very successful and he sold it for 480 million dollars. Carnegie was a very wealthy man but he was more interested in philanthropy than spending his money on himself. He spent the rest of his life giving his money away to worthy causes. Reading and learning were very important to him, so he built many libraries. He also established universities and research institutes. Carnegie built hospitals, museums, and theaters. One of the most recognizable buildings he built was Carnegie Hall in New York City. Carnegie Hall hosts many concerts and symphonies each year and is an important part of New York City culture. Andrew Carnegie passed away at the age of 83.

A lot of people who study Law at University do so because they want to become practising lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors. But it is not necessary to read Law at University to become a practising lawyer. Equally, studying Law at University is a legitimate subject for academic study even if you definitely do not want to become a lawyer or think that you may not become a practising lawyer. That is because the study of Law at University is not a vocational subject; it is an academic subject and an intellectual discipline. Even those students who study Law at University intending to become practising lawyers are required to do additional vocational training to prepare them for working either as a barrister or a solicitor; for them the study of Law at University by itself is not sufficient to train them to become lawyers.

The function of Vitamin D is to maintain blood calcium. You probably think the function of Vitamin D is to maintain strong bones and teeth. But it does that by accident. Its real function is to maintain your blood calcium level in a very narrow range. And the reason for that is if your blood calcium level falls below about 9 milligrams per 100 milliliters, then you're longing to be in a big trouble, and die rather quickly. And that's because blood calcium is important for muscle contraction and nerve transmission. And if you don't have enough of it, you can't contract muscles normally.There can't be normal nerve impulses.

The oldest fossil proto frog appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is found in tropical rain forests. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semipermeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in they are breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one-third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.

I think that it takes on a few different definitions in one sense of the word. Globalization means proliferation of transactions across country. So, one way of thinking about globalization is a way to describe, increase international communications, more trade happening between countries and be less self-sufficient in providing goods and services to their people and more companies that have offices in multiple countries, which we call multinationals. So, the source of growth in travel and communication and corporate trade across borders. And this way of thinking about globalization is the continuation of thinking that has been around for a long time, such as when the Europeans went to the Orient, to find spices, which was also an example of global trade and communication. Another way to think of globalization though, is an economic system. It is a system in which countries become integrated in a way that never had been before. In this system, we see a global split in the process between consuming and producing goods. Some countries produce goods, some countries consume goods, and then these countries in different areas of the globe depend on each other in a kind of organic solidarity rather than having an economic system being just inside your country. The system is the way economy in your country functions depends on economy of another country. And in fact this way of thinking about globalizations represents a new area of economic progression.

Let me introduce a couple of technical terms: extrinsic value and intrinsic value. To understand Aristotle's interest in happiness, you need to understand this distinction. Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves. If I value something as means to something else, then it has what we will call 'extrinsic value', other things we desire and hold to be valuable for themselves alone. If we value something not as means to something else, but for its own sake, let us say that it has 'intrinsic value', exercise. There may be some people who value exercise for itself, but I don't. I value exercise because if I exercise, I tend to stay healthier than I would if I didn't.

The tiny, delicate skeletons are usually scattered by scavengers or destroyed by weathering before they can be fossilized. Ichthyosaurs had a higher chance of being preserved than did terrestrial creatures because, as marine animals, they tended to live in environments less subject to erosion. Still, their fossilization required a suite of factors: a slow rate of decay of soft tissues, little scavenging by other animals, a lack of swift currents and waves to jumble and carry away small bones, and fairly rapid burial. Given these factors, some areas have become a treasury of well-preserved ichthyosaur fossils. The deposits at Holzmaden, Germany, present an interesting case for analysis. The ichthyosaur remains are found in black, bituminous marine shales deposited about 190 million years ago. Over the years, thousands of specimens of marine reptiles, fish and invertebrates have been recovered from these rocks. The quality of preservation is outstanding, but what is even more impressive is the number of ichthyosaur fossils containing preserved embryos. Ichthyosaurs with embryos have been reported from 6 different levels of the shale in a small area around Holzmaden, suggesting that a specific site was used by large numbers of ichthyosaurs repeatedly over time. The embryos are quite advanced in their physical development; their paddles, for example, are already well formed. One specimen is even preserved in the birth canal. In addition, the shale contains the remains of many newborns that are between 20 and 30 inches long. Why are there so many pregnant females and young at Holzmaden when they are so rare elsewhere? The quality of preservation is almost unmatched and quarry operations have been carried out carefully with an awareness of the value of the fossils. But these factors do not account for the interesting question of how there came to be such a concentration of pregnant ichthyosaurs in a particular place very close to their time of giving birth.","orderId":"SST0150","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20211027_1635348716914.mp3","answer":"We appear to take it as a rule, or as a law of nature, that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home. For example, species from the Arctic, or even a temperate region, could not survive in a tropical climate, nor could a tropical species last long if it found itself at the South Pole. But it is true to say there’s too much emphasis placed on the degree of adaptation of species to the climates where they live. We assume that this adaptation – if all species are descended from a single form – must have taken place over millions of years, yet a large number of plants and animals brought from different countries remain perfectly healthy in their new home. Also, there are several examples of animal species that have extended their range, within historical times, from warmer to cooler latitudes and the other way round. Rats and mice provide good examples: they have been transported by man to many parts of the world and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, and they can be found living in the cold climate of the Faroe Islands to the north through the tropical zones to the Falklands in the south. It is possible to see adaptation to any climate as a quality that is part of an inborn flexibility of the physical and mental constitution of most animals. Therefore, the ability to survive in the most different climates by both man and his domestic animals, and the fact that elephants once existed in an ice age while living species live in tropical areas, should not be seen as deviations from the rule, but as examples of this flexibility being brought into action under particular circumstances.","orderId":"SST0151","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20220518_1652859406866.mp3","answer":"So various conclusions.

It is more important than ever to understand how autocracies work. Autocrats have a keen interest in promoting the idea that they are all powerful. Whereas leaders in democracies can be removed via elections, leaders in autocracies can lose office in two ways: via a coup or popular revolt. To make matters worse, autocrats can rarely address both threats at the same time. They often have to choose whether to reward their elite cronies to prevent a coup or the masses to prevent a revolt. This generates many difficult tradeoffs. Cheat too little on elections and risk losing office, but cheat too much and signal weakness to your opponents. Use corruption to reward your elite friends, but not so much that it slows economic growth and sparks a revolt. Manipulate the media, but not so much that people turn off the television.

Globalization can usefully be conceived as a process (or set of processes), which embodies a transformation in the spatial organization of social relations, and transactions, generating transcontinental or interregional flows and networks of activity, interaction and power. It is characterized by four types of change:First, it involves a stretching of social, political and economic activities across political frontiers, regions and continents. Second, it suggests the intensification, or the growing magnitude, of interconnectedness and flows of trade, investment, finance, migration, culture, etc. Third, the growing extensity and intensity of global interconnectedness can be linked to a speeding up of global interactions and processes, as the evolution of world-wide systems of transport and communication increases the velocity of the diffusion of ideas, goods, information, capital, and people. -Fourth, the growing extensity, intensity and velocity of global interactions can be associated with their deepening impact such that the effects of distant events can be highly significant elsewhere and even the most local developments may come to have enormous global consequences. In this sense, the boundaries between domestic matters and global affairs can become increasingly blurred.Globalization has three definitions. There are more trade transactions, communications, services and multinational companies across the border. There are more travels and cooperation between different countries. A global and integrated economic system has been formed in the world.

For many people, language acquisition starts around about twelve months when kids say that first word, but don't forget the first year. At the first year, our first year of life is very important as well and indeed before you are born, remember there are couple of months before you are born, when you actually able to perceive in the womb, something of the language that's around you. So language acquisition starts earlier than most people think. And it also ends later than most people think. When does child language acquisition stop? Well, in a sense, you know, we are all children, we stay being children all in our lives. There is no obvious endpoint for learning sounds, of course, there is for learning grammar, there is for vocabulary, huh. I mean that goes on for the rest of our lives in million or more words in English. Most of us only have a vocabulary of 50, 60, 70 thousand words, whatever it is until there is always something to learn.

When I started out 40 years ago, we thought we knew that the universe began with a Big Bang. Some people doubted even that. We thought the universe was about 10 or 20 million years old. But now for really very sound scientific reasons, we can say that the universe did start with the Big Bang, and it's 13.8 billion years old. So it's not 14, it's not 13, because of the decimal point in there. And that's a stunning achievement to know that, and we also know that the laws of physics that apply to tiny particles.  Besides, Adams also explains what happened in the Big Bang. You can't have one without the other. A very neat example of this is that when you apply nuclear physics, that kind of physics, to understand how stars work, you find out that the oldest star in the universe is about 13 billion years old. So the universe is just a little bit older than the stars. Fantastic! If we have done it and counted in the other way around, and said that the stars were older than the universe, we would say science were in deep trouble.  But it's not. Everything fits together and we know how the universe began. We got to know how the way it is.

[Todd Weber] Dan, there are a number of dangers. Parents should know that leftover drugs are dangerous because they may be accidentally ingested by children. Either adults don’t keep the bottles properly closed and stored or because even young kids can sometimes open childproof lids. Patients may use the drugs after their expiration date. The leftover drugs may be taken for the wrong reasons. For example, someone may have a viral infection and self-prescribe the leftover antimicrobial that was prescribed for a bacterial infection. But that drug will have no effect against a viral infection. Drugs that are leftover might be given to or taken by someone else who may have a serious allergy to the medicine and who, for that reason, would not be prescribed the medicine under the supervision of a physician. Finally, inappropriate use of drugs promotes drug resistance if the drug is taken for the wrong indication, the wrong duration, or in the wrong dosage. [Dan Rutz] Todd, what can people do about this? How can the situation be improved? [Todd Weber] I think physicians, patients, and parents of patients can take steps to improve the situation. First of all, physicians should prescribe the drug only when appropriate, only in the correct amount, and only for the correct duration. Also, the physician must stress to the patient that the full course of the drug must be taken. This is recommended even if symptoms resolve before the end of the prescription.

Researchers have known for a while that flower’s color can be a signal. Color in short hand that says to a bee: hey, I get some good quality nectar here, want to stop by for a visit.

Bees use up a lot of energy just stay in warm on some days. In fact, they can’t even fly if they are too cold. So if one flower is warmer than another, a bee can save some of its fuel by basking on that flower while it’s doing its pollinating business. And it turns out that bumble bees consistently do choose warmer flowers over cooler ones, even when the two flowers offer up the same quantity and quality of nectar.

A similar phenomenon has also occurred in other parts of the animal kingdom. The African grass mouse is a good example. Most mice are nocturnal, but the African grass mouse is active during daylight hours. This means that it spends its days searching for food in the semidry bush and scrub habitats of eastern and southern Africa. Its fur is striped, like a chipmunk’s, which helps it blend in with its environment. Because it spends a lot of time in the intense tropical sun, the grass mouse has also evolved two separate safeguards against the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. First, like the populations of humans in this region of the world, the skin of the grass mouse contains lots of melanin, or dark pigment. Second, and quite unusual, this mouse has a layer of melanin-pigmented tissue between its skull and skin.

Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed, in many types of wood, to the exact calendar year. This has three main areas of application: paleoecology, where it is used to determine certain aspects of past ecologists (most prominently climate) archaeology and the history of art and architecture, where it is used to date old panel paintings on wood, buildings etc; and radiocarbon dating, where it is used to calibrate radiocarbon ages. In some areas of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. As of 2013, fully anchored chronologies in the northern hemisphere extend back 13,900 years.

An experiment was conducted on the environment and climate in the 1930s when people first noticed climate change. Humans have been trying to change their lifestyles to deal with it, but the observation of climate change is difficult from area to area. A method is introduced to help understand the mechanism of the climate system. Researchers predict that temperatures will increase about two to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. What's less certain is what rising temperatures mean for the planet. Some climate models predict subtle changes. Others forecast rising sea levels, which could flood coastal areas around the world. Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent. Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas, and species unable to adapt to the changing conditions would face extinction, although much remains to be learned about global warming. Many organizations advocate cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impact of global warming. Consumers can help by saving energy around the house, switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs, and driving fewer miles in the car each week.

But crops affect climate themselves and they do this in two ways. First of all, about one-quarter of the land surface is used for growing crops. Another 10-15 % are used for pasture. So a substantial amount of the land surface is used in crop and agricultural production. And how we used that land affects our climate? If we were, for example, to deforest a substantial area and replace it with the annual crop such as soybean. Then we would alter the characteristics of the land surface, alter the way that water and heat flows from the land surface to the atmosphere and back, and ultimately change the regional climate if that is not enough to change the land surface. So this is an absolutely fascinating topic and one that’s really quite difficult to understand because of the complexity.

For similar reasons, the United States will specialize in the production of goods that are human- and physical-capital intensive because of the relative abundance of a highly educated labor force and technically sophisticated equipment in the United States. This division of global production should yield higher global output of both types of goods than would be the case if each country attempted to produce both of these goods itself. For example, the United States would produce more expensive labor-intensive goods because of its more expensive labor and the developing countries would produce more expensive human and physical capital-intensive goods because of their relative scarcity of these inputs. This logic implies that the United States is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the production of green technologies that are not relatively intensive in human and physical capital. Nevertheless, during the early stages of the development of a new technology, the United States has a comparative advantage in the production of the products enabled by this innovation.

I think it’s fair to say that these pattern books were the most important influence on the design of North American houses during the nineteenth century. This was because most people who wanted to build a house couldn’t afford to hire an architect. Instead, they bought a pattern book, picked out a plan, and took it to the builder. The difference in cost was substantial. In 1870, for example, hiring an architect would’ve cost about a hundred dollars. At the same time, a pattern book written by an architect cost only five dollars. At that price, it’s easy to see why pattern books were so popular.

Instincts are present across species and are consistent within the individual species. In other words, many different species rely on instincts and if one member of a species possesses an instinct, then they all do.  Before we move into a discussion of specific types of instincts, it is important to distinguish the difference between an instinct and a reflex. Both are types of unlearned behavior that tend to serve a survival purpose. The difference is that a reflex is typically a simple reaction, or a response to an environmental trigger, whereas an instinct is a much more complex set of behaviors.  For instance, an example of a reflex would be when a baby turns his head toward an object. That is pressed against one cheek in an effort to nurse. The head turn is a simple reactionary process, and instincts would be the manner in which a mother bird regurgitates her food to feed her young, in response to their signals of hunger.

The drug industry says the ads arm consumers with information. But researchers found that though the information was technically accurate, the tone was misleading. UCLA psychologist Dominick Frosch headed the study.  'What we would see in these ads is that before taking the prescription drug, the character’s life was out of control and the loss of control really extended beyond just the impact of the health condition. For example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days, insomniacs utterly out of synch on the job and depressed patients friendless and boring at parties. “When the character is then shown taking the drug he then magically regains complete control of his life.” None of the ads, of course, mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition. After all, it's mass marketing. But in this case, Frosch says, prescription medications are not soap.","orderId":"SST0206","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT1601886406579_stdnew.mp3","answer":"So, there is an example comes from the other end of life and has to do with what's called wonder babies.

They showed those babies various puppets and then they switched the situation. typically, when the seven-month-old baby is used to particular setting and the situation switches it takes them a little while to regroup.  So turned out that seven-month-old Italian and seven-month-old Slovenian babies would get used to the puppet appearing on the right, and then when the puppet would appear on the left they would continue looking to the right as if nothing had Changed.

The global economic and financial crisis concerns common ethical standards. For example, the trade between Europe and the United States has been unfair, which needs to be further negotiated. These problems of the global economy should be on the agenda for the following years.

For example, long-term illness such as diabetes and heart disease are caused by depression.  One of the studies shows children with depression behave differently and respond differently to medical treatment. This is why many specialists respond differently to medical treatment. This is why many specialists have tried bringing a cure but no one found a perfect medicine. It is quite rare that children suffer from depression but in the recent study the number has dramatically increased. Nowadays no one doubt about children's depression.

Saul Eslake: Essentially, it's a by-product of how well the Australian economy has been doing over the last 15 years. We've had 15 years of more or less uninterrupted economic growth, during which average earnings have risen by close to 90 per cent, while over the course of that period the standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved. That's meant that the amount which a typical, home-buying household can afford to borrow - under rules which aren't as strictly applied as they used to be - has more than doubled. Over the same period, rising immigration and falling average household size have meant that the number of households looking for accommodation has risen by about 1.5 million, that's around 200,000 more than the number of dwellings has increased by. So, you've had a substantial increase in the purchasing power of households, no net increase in the supply of housing and, hence, all of that additional purchasing power has gone into pushing up the price of housing.","orderId":"SST0212","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20210715_1626273853565.mp3","answer":"Australia is a vibrant, multicultural country.

This is intense emotional responses that often manifest themselves as shivers, tingling of the spines. Anybody here had this. Ok, it's not uncommon and they specifically looked at chills to instrumental music.  So this wasn't due to any associations that people had with lyrics, it was just sounds of music. And they looked it. They took advantage of the fact that people often know quite well what music gives them chills.

Stress can be something that makes you better, but it is a question of how much, how long and how you interpret or perceive it.

Time management helps you to reduce long-term stress by giving you direction when you have too much work to do.

In the book, Michaels, et al., describe not a set of superior Human Resources processes, but a mindset that emphasizes the importance of talent to the success of organizations.The war for talent is intensified by demographic shifts (primarily in the United States and Europe). This is characterized by increasing demand along with decreasing supply(demographically). There are simply fewer post-baby- boom workers to replace the babyboom retirement in the US and Europe (though this is not the case in most of East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Central America, South America, or the Middle East; Eastern Europe also tends to have similar demographics, namely an aging and/or shrinking labor force).While talent is vague or ill-defined, the underlying assumption is that for knowledge intensive industries, the knowledge worker (a term coined by Peter Drucker) is the key competitive resource (see the Resource-based view of the firm). Knowledge-based theories of organizations consistently place knowledge workers as a primary, competitive resource. Talent is never explicitly defined in the book, though the Preface notes, 'A certain part of talent elude description: You simply know it when you see it.' After several further caveats, the authors go on: 'We can say, however, that managerial talent is some combination of a sharp strategic mind, leadership ability, emotional maturity, communications skills, the ability to attract and inspire other talented people, entrepreneurial instincts, functional skills, and the ability to deliver results.' The authors offer no outside support for this assertion.A 2006 article in The Economist, which mentions the book, notes that, 'companies do not even know how to define 'talent', let alone how to manage it. Some use it to mean people like Aldous Huxley's alphas in 'Brave New World'—those at the top of the bell curve. Others employ it as a synonym for the entire workforce, a definition so broad as to be meaningless.' The 'War for talent is seen by various sources as becoming irrelevant during economic downturns.

At its roots, architecture exists to create the physical environment in which people live, but architecture is more than just the built environment, it’s also a part of our culture. It stands as a representation of how we see ourselves, as well as how we see the world. There are poorly designed buildings, but also some great building works. In the Victoria Era, architects designed buildings based on bricks and other materials. The design of flaws was based on lighting as it would not only affect appearance but also health conditions. The materials that buildings are made of also matter. For example, the design of ground floors must ensure that the building is able to withstand the weight of the higher levels. In the 20th century, many old buildings with design flaws were demolished or modified through a natural selection process, which means they are an altered state rather than an original state. This is an application of Darwin's theory of natural selection to modification of old buildings, which means buildings should adapt to the new world to survive, or be pulled down. So, it's argued to be unfair to criticize the demolition, although some people believe that whether to be remained should be decided based on their nature and functions.

Then everybody was crowded into factories and the new brave world opened up. In fact, one of the most interesting books and great classics that is still in print was written by an economic historian at Harvard who's still alive called David Landes. It's a good book called The Unbound Prometheus, which was basically that. Some of the inventions that I briefly describe in your reading, the spinning Jenny, etc, refer to that.  Well, and that kind of analysis led one to concentrate on England where the Industrial Revolution began, and to view industrialization as beginning a situation of winners and losers by not going as fast.  Now, that analysis has been really rejected greatly over the past years, because Industrial Revolution is measured by more than simply large factories with industrial workers and the number of machines. This is the point of the beginning of this. The more that we look at the Industrial Revolution, the more that we see that the Industrial Revolution was first and foremost an intensification of forms of production, of kinds of production that were already there. And thus, we spend more time looking at, you know, the intensification of artisanal production, craft production, of domestic industry, which we've already mentioned, that is people mostly women but also men and children, too, working in the countryside.

Leaders can mobilize people’s energies in ways that range from subtle, quiet persuasion to the coercive threat or the use of deadly force. Sometimes a charismatic leader such as Martin Luther King Jr. can define goals and mobilize energies through rhetoric and the power of example. We can think of leadership as a spectrum, in terms of both visibility and the power the leader wields. On one end of the spectrum, we have the most visible: authoritative leaders like the president of the United States or the prime minister of the United Kingdom, or a dictator such as Hitler or Qaddafi. At the opposite end of the spectrum is casual, low-key leadership found in countless situations every day around the world, leadership that can make a significant difference to the individuals whose lives are touched by it. Over the centuries, the first kind–the out-in-front, authoritative leadership–has generally been exhibited by men. Some men in positions of great authority, including Nelson Mandela, have chosen a strategy of “leading from behind”; more often, however, top leaders have been quite visible in their exercise of power. Women (as well as some men) have provided casual, low-key leadership behind the scenes. But this pattern has been changing, as more women have taken up opportunities for visible, authoritative leadership.","orderId":"SST0233","repeated":true,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT1603694387732_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Both music and language have a lot of similarities: They involve complex sequences that unfold in time. They are both forms of communication. This has interested all the world's best philosophers from Plato going back over 2000 years ago. Scientists like Darwin wrote about possible evolutionary links between music and language in his book the Descent of Man and so did artists like Leonard Bernstein who gave a series of lectures at Harvard in the 70s. He spoke about the grammar of language and the grammar of music from Noam Chomsky's theories.  So it's a persistent question. It keeps drawing interest from scientists today but there are some basic obvious similarities. For example, both music and language have rhythmic systematic patterns of timing accent and grouping. Both language and music have melody-structured patterns of pitch, over time. Both have syntax, discrete elements like words or notes, and principles for combining those elements into sequences. Sentences are just random sequences of words. Both convey effect which means emotion using sound.

Increasing agriculture productivity, reduces labour needs and opportunities in the rural areas, pushing people towards to the cities. There is this notion that in order to have progress and development in cities, you need people. If everybody is busing growing to crops, growing food that exists, you can't have people all going into the city. You need to increased productivity in the countryside. You need to have one farmer producing enough food for more than one family. And then you will have growth and productivity in the countryside, which will free of people move to the cities.

Public health authorities told Mary to give up working as a cook or have her gallbladder removed, as she had a chronic infection that kept her active as a carrier of the disease. Mary quit her job, but returned later under a false name. She was detained and quarantined after another typhoid outbreak. She died of pneumonia after 26 years in quarantine. Mary Mallon born in 1869 and migrate to America from Ireland. She was an excellent cook. She got along well with her colleagues and friends though sometimes she felt bored with her boss.

You actually don’t know that when you are using the bulk of your memory. And this is called implicit or procedural memory. This includes things like cultural and social norms, so kind of understanding how you are supposed to behave in a classroom or expecting a certain thing to happen when you walk into a restaurant. These are all things that we have learnt and acquired over our years but it’s not necessarily something that we think about. Language, also, in many aspects, is something that is fairly automatic and we’ve acquired and used very naturally, and other learned skills such as reading or driving. These are things that might have been effortful at one time, but now they just come very easily and automatically to us. And in fact, if you actually try to describe to somebody how you drive or how to drive, it actually kind of messes you up. So these are in a lot of , well, in a lot of cases, consciousness kind of gets in the way of a lot of these aspects of implicit memory. Now when we're talking about our memory, so for instance, people tell me a lot that their memories are bad, when people are saying, when they talk about their memory, they’re usually talking about explicit or episodic memory, and these are very different from implicit memories. These are memories that have a very specific tag or space and time. These are highly personal memories usually, so this could be everything from remembering what you ate for breakfast to what you did on your last vacation, or remembering a significant birthday that you had several years ago or in the past, or just an answer to a multiple choice question on a test.","orderId":"SST0237","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1772463_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT_stdnew.mp3","answer":"Hello, it's Megan. This week I'm going to talk about the difference between translators and interpreters. It’s a common misconception that translators and interpreters do the same thing. So, I just like to highlight a few similarities and differences between the two.  Firstly, translation refers to written communication whereas interpreting refers to verbal communication. So, for example, a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved. But would translate the written evidence used in the case.  Secondly, both jobs require different skills. I translate to require the ability to write well and comprehensively into a target language. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their native language. For example, although I can speak French to a good standard. I cannot translate from English to French although I could translate from French to English, which means I’m only half way there to being an international player. An interpreter needs to be able to speak both languages proficiently.  Thirdly, the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ. Both roles acquire years of training, the resulting qualification. But what they can learn from the training Will be completely different.

A recent controversy as to whether labels on prepared foods should educate or merely inform the consumer is over and a consumer group got its way. The group maintained that the product labels should do more than simply list how many grams of nutrients food contains. Their contention was that labels should also list the percentage of a day's total nutrients that the product would supply to the consumer because this information is essential in planning a healthy diet. A government agency disagrees strongly favoring a label that merely informs the consumer. In other words, a label that only lists the contents of the product. The agency maintained that consumers could decide for themselves if the food is nutritious and is meeting their daily needs. The consumer group in supporting its case has cited a survey in which shoppers were shown a food label and with an ask if they would need more or less of a certain nutrient after eating a survey of this product.

Interviewee: Well, probably the best source of nutritional guidelines are those that are issued by the American Cancer Society or the National Cancer Institute. And the American Cancer Society, for example, offers four really basic, simple nutrition guidelines. The first guideline, which in my mind is the most important, is to choose most of the foods that you eat from plant sources, and we can talk in more detail about that in a moment. The second guideline is to limit your intake of high fat foods, particularly from animal sources. The third guideline is to be physically active and achieve a normal, healthy body weight.

Let's take a step back for a moment to provide a larger framework that helps you understand the idea of semantic noise a bit easier. Communication is the process of transmitting information from one person to another. Information is a pattern of data organized in a particular way. For example, a sentence consists of symbols that form words in a particular language with a particular meaning. The sentence also utilizes grammar, which is a recognized way to structure words forming a sentence. Noise is any type of disturbance that interferes with the interpretation of the information. Some argue that noise exists in all communication. Semantic noise doesn't involve sound but rather ambiguity in words, sentences or other symbols used in communication. The ambiguity is caused because everybody sees a different meaning in the same words, phrases or sentences. The differences in interpretation can be quite small, even undetectable, in regular communication between people from the same culture, age, education and experience, or drastically different because of such things as culture, age or experience.","orderId":"SST0242","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT1603521727115_stdnew.mp3","answer":"In my view, it's impossible not to talk about wildlife, and not think about its role in livelihood.

It can seem close to impossible—and then suddenly there it is: that elusive, seemingly joyous grin. Well it turns out those smiles aren’t spontaneous—they’re strategic. Researchers have found that when babies smile, it's for a reason. They want whoever they’re interacting with— typically a parent—to smile back. And they time it just so, a smile here and a smile there. The researchers call it sophisticated timing. The study is in the journal PLoS ONE. The researchers enlisted real mothers and infants and quantified their interactions, which fell into four categories. One: babies wanted to maximize the amount of time smiling at their mothers. Two: they wanted to maximize the time the mothers smiled at them. Three: they wanted to experience simultaneous smiling, and four: no smiling at all. By studying when smiles happened and what the subsequent effect was, the investigators were able to figure out that for mothers the goal 70 percent of the time was to be smiling simultaneously—while for babies 80 percent of the time they just wanted their mother smiling at them.

I don't think there really are any pure languages in the world. But English is definitely not a pure language. English, in fact, has borrowed from over 350 languages in its history. So it's a variety of many languages. Some people say it’s like a dog, a mongrel dog, a dog that has been made up of many different dogs. The English language is like that. By looking at the history of the English language we learn about the history of the English people. The two things are closely connected. So, in fact, today we are not only learning about language but we are learning about history. The fact that English has borrowed words from over 350 languages has been viewed differently throughout history.

So, to help you with the final touches on your assignments, I wanted to say a few words about proofreading. Most people find it easy to spot problems with grammar or punctuation when reading someone else's writing but it's always much harder to see these things when looking at your own. Since you won't always have the luxury of having someone else proofread for you, let's look at a few ways to effectively do it yourself. When proofreading your own work it's important that you know what kind of errors you're looking for. Think about the kinds of things you've had trouble with in the past and try to eliminate them for a start. Now, most people know to look for things like grammar, spelling and punctuation but don't forget that the big picture is just as important. Make sure your work is organized in a logical way and that each paragraph represents a clear, distinct idea. You might take yourself to a quiet spot and try reading your work aloud. As you do, make sure it flows. Don't forget to check your referencing and citations. If possible, try to give yourself at least a day or two to complete the proofreading process.

When I started out forty-odd years ago, we thought we knew that the universe began a big bang, some people doubted even then. We thought the universe was about ten or twenty billion years old. But now for really very sound scientific reasons, we can say that the universe did start in a Big bang and it’s 13.8 billion years old. So it’s not 14, it's not 13 because a decimal point in there and that’s a stunning achievement to know that. And we also know that the laws of physics that apply to tiny particles inside atoms also explains what happened in the big bang, you can’t have one without the other. A very neat example of this is that when you apply nuclear physics, that kind of physics to understand how stars work, you find out that the oldest star in the universe is about 13 billion years old. So their universe is just a little bit older than the stars. Fantastic, if we done it and counted in the other way around and said that the stars were older than the universe, we would say science was in deep trouble.

I'm talking about the so-called developed world, the developed world gets 80 or 90% of all its energy from fossil fuels and living on fossil fuels for energy. In this way, it's not sustainable for three fairly obvious reasons.  First, on the left easily-accessible fossil fuels are a finite resource and so some point that resource will be exploited and humanity will have to do something else.  Second, setting fire to fossil fuels puts carbon dioxide upstairs. So, we have the climate motivation. The clear consensus of the climate science community is with substantial aerobars still on exactly what might happen. Their advice is this is a geoengineering experiment that was well advised to stop as soon as possible.  And third, even if you don't believe in climate change and even if global fossil fuels aren't running out today, it might be the case that your fossil fuels or our fossil fuels in a particular country or state have run out and you might depend on other countries or states for fossil fuels in the future.

Unfortunately most of the guidebook information is wildly out-of-date. The travels of John Mandeville, despite posing as a guidebook, is actually just a sort of combination of many eleventh and twelfth century sources. Mandeville ripped pieces from one source bits from another and put them together in a big melting pot and one continuous narrative. A storyteller at heart, Mandeville quickly leaves the guidebook behind and starts spinning tales. Now based on events described within the travels of John Mandeville we can say fairly definitively that it was written after 1360 which would seem to jive with the 1366 date that Mandeville gifts for when he finished his narrative. Now while there is no original manuscript known to survive we do have a very early copy from 1371. It was written in French although it’s heavily peppered with Anglicanism, suggesting that the book was written in English initially and later translated to French. The 15th century copy of the work says it was originally written in Latin, translated into French and then translated into English that it might reach men of all parts of the world but this seems to be a much later edition. The work was quickly translated into all the dialects and languages of Europe, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Bohemia and even Gaelic. We have three early English manuscripts although they’re all post 14 hundred but to give something of an indication of how popular Mandeville’s work was. We do have over 300 surviving manuscripts versions of the travels of John Mandeville, as opposed to only 77 of Marco Polo.

I want to talk about what I do as a curator and then from that also talk a bit about the kinds of history that I think museums are particularly good at creating and communicating. I think this is something I would really like to discuss because it is not necessarily very well understood is that I think museums, as Dave insisted by putting up my quote in his slide, create a very particular kind of history. It’s not the kind of history that gets created in books or in dating films or in compositions, it’s a very particular kind of history that grows out of the fact that museums are centrally interested and defined by their collections. I should say that is not an uncontested view of museums but it is certainly my view of museums. Curators try to understand material culture as an evidence of other people’s lives as a means to try to understand other people - what they look like, what they did, how they made a living, what they hoped for in their lives, how they tried to construct their world and why they made particular choices. One way in which curators differ from other historians is therefore in terms of how we interrogate the past, what elements we use to communicate the past. Most academic historians are trained very much in the discipline of words and they concentrate on words still today, although it is changing a little bit. If you go through university history primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like archival accounts, manuscripts and now oral histories, and most of that work is actually promulgated in the form of books. There are also other kinds of historians. Obviously, filmmakers and photographers concentrate on creating images of the world and arranging them in meaningful sequences, but curators attend to objects. We look at objects as evidence of the past and try to arrange objects in meaningful ways called exhibitions.","orderId":"SST0272","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1772479_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT_stdnew.mp3","answer":"In this video we're going to find out how animal bones found in an island cave in the Adriatic Sea tell us about the movement of people during the last glacial maximum from research carried out by pierre spry marquez. 23,000 years ago towards the end of the Old Stone Age also known as the Upper Paleolithic, the weather in Europe and in many parts of the world took a turn for the worse. Temperatures plummeted, rain levels fell and a massive ice sheet slowly advanced to cover most of northern Europe and stay there for the next few thousand years.  We know that during this glacial period, many animal and plant species sought shelter in Europe's three warmer southern peninsulas: Iberia, Italy and the Balkans. But the question is where did the people go? Archaeological material recovered from this time period has shown that a large number of our ancestors retreated to Franco Cantabria, an area covering the southwest of France and northeastern tip of Spain. But was this the only area where people traveled to to escape the worst of the weather?  Let's go back to the growing ice sheet. In order to grow the ice mass had to take up water causing sea levels to fall. At its maximum when the ice reached as far south as Germany, sea levels were up to 120 metres lower than today. That's approximately the same height as the London Eye.

The status quo is not sustainable. Super diversity stocktake, which I will talk to you about now, is designed to help us to adapt to a super diverse New Zealand to make sure that we fit for the future. Because New Zealand is super diverse right now, predominately in Auckland but actually throughout New Zealand. Here we're already 50% Māori Pasifika and Asian, 44% are not born in New Zealand. And we have over 200 ethnicities. Now the definition academically of super diversity is 25% not born in New Zealand, a hundred ethnicities. So we are almost double that number already. And Auckland will continue to become younger and browner as the Anglo-Saxon population ages and shrinks. So the mega trend here is not age and the myth. The mega trend here is not urbanization. The mega trend is demography. It's ethnicity and we need to get our head around that because most of the benefits from super diversity that we as a country are enjoying at the moment, such as greater innovation productivity and investment increase New Zealand's financial capital whereas most of the challenges from super diversity adversely affect New Zealand's social capital. However if you don't mitigate the challenges to your social capital, you are not going to maximize sustainably the diversity dividend benefits for your financial capital.","orderId":"SST0284","repeated":false,"difficulty":"hard"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_1772468_LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT_stdnew.mp3","answer":"And I am the professor of children's literature at Newcastle University. And I want to write a very short introduction to children's literature because although, here in Britain, we have one of the longest and most distinguished traditions of creating books for children, perhaps the longest and most distinguished in the world, we often take them for granted, and we don't pay enough attention to what a remarkable cultural resource they are for adults, and the kind of cultural work they do for children, and the way that they have served writers and illustrators as a cultural space for creativity subversion and opportunities to experiment with new ideas.  So what kind of cultural work the children's books do? Well, at the level of individual child, this is one of the places where children learn the vocabularies, get the vicarious experiences, and see the images of the world that help them think about how the world works and where they fit into it. Because children's books are one of the first places that children encounter these things, they are often very direct as a source of information about what a particular period thinks, including what it thinks a child is, what a child needs to know, what childhood looks like. Sometimes when we are looking at children's books from the past, that's very important to notice the kinds of children who aren't there, for instance.

The standard business response is to say they are more exclusive. And we get exclusivity by having high price and relatively small amounts of the product available. The reality, however, of luxury brands is that they are sold in their millions, and in some cases, are not priced that much higher than the standard output. The only way I can really answer your question is to say, it is all relative. As you said in your introduction, it wasn't that long ago in Australia that we would have considered two televisions to be a luxury, or even further back, one colour television. And you can make a strong argument, for example, that Starbucks in China, right now, is a luxury purchase because of its cost, because of how frequently it is purchased by many people. So, I think the long answer is a complicated one, but the answer is, it depends who you talk to. I think in the business community what we would say, is that there is a small cluster of more expensive brands which have a distinct strategy that we would identify as being luxury brands.

Today I will discuss this course on the general condition of how animals survive and reproduce. This is very interesting, because animal survival and reproduction mainly involves factors, which include temperature tolerance, body size, behavior, and the altitude they live in.  Here is an example. Imagine animals that can survive only in hot environment. Now if these same animals are put into a freezer, you will notice it will die very soon. Those species who have tolerance temperature to cold can only survive. This is why climates and seasons are quite important for animal survival.  Various species have to maintain their body underwater, and tolerate different temperature in various seasons. Finally, I would like to point out that, some of these species or animals can adapt to climate change, by changing their behavior and daily activity in the habitats they live in.","orderId":"SST0288","repeated":false,"difficulty":"easy"},{"type":"LISTENING_SUMMARIZE_SPOKEN_TEXT","audioLink":"https://storage.googleapis.com/pte-magic-question-2018/question_20210322_1616411598947.mp3","answer":"So the topic for today is abstraction. And this is a very important layer of computer because you can't do anything with a computer unless you have a symbolic system in place. Right. So we're talking about the origin of symbolic systems. Language is a classic symbolic system. Apparently one theory for why language evolved is that people communicated with sign language and with movement quite well for a long time. And it turned out that they wanted to communicate even while they were doing things. So, while they were trying to strangle the dinosaur, not the dinosaurs, the rhinoceros, they wanted to say 'Come help me' and they use sign language to do it. They had to let go of the rhinoceros and the rhinoceros ran away. So you can see that it's a good idea to be able to do something with your hands and be able to communicate at the same time.

At the same time, it can be described to the somewhat cautious document that provides the starting point for a wider application of law to rights.  In many ways, the freedom some protections contained in the Human Rights Act were not new to people living in the UK. The Act puts into UK law most of the clauses of the European Convention on Human Rights. The convention itself was devised following the end of the Second World War by the Council of Europe. UK law has played a significant role in the drafting of the Convention, and the UK was among the first governments to ratify the Convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature, that's to say, some can be expressed as a right to, and others as freedom from.  The 1998 act puts into place 15 specific rights and freedoms which include rights to liberty and security a free trial, free expression, free elections, and the right to marry and to found a family. There are also freedoms from torture, from slavery or forced labour, and from discrimination on grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion, or social origin. The Human Rights Act has been described as the start of a process.

Activists worked together and used non-violent protest and specific acts of targeted civil disobedience, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Greensboro Woolworth Sit-Ins, in order to bring about change. Much of this organizing and activism took place in the Southern part of the United States; however, people from all over the country—of all races and religions—joined activists to proclaim their support and commitment to freedom and equality. For example, on August 28, 1963, 250,000 Americans came to Washington, D.C. for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. They came to have their voices heard and listen to speeches by many civil rights leaders, especially Martin Luther King, Jr., who delivered what would become one of the most influential speeches in history. In the aftermath of World War II, African American civil rights efforts were hampered by ideological splits. The Southern system of white supremacy was accompanied by the expansion of European and American imperial control over nonwhite people in Africa and Asia as well as in island countries of the Pacific and Caribbean regions. Like African Americans, most nonwhite people throughout the world were colonized or economically exploited and denied basic rights, such as the right to vote.

Parents should know that leftover drugs are dangerous because they may be accidentally ingested by children. Either adults don’t keep the bottles properly closed and stored or because even many kids can sometimes open childproof lids. Patients may use the drugs after their expiration date. The leftover drugs may be taken for the wrong reasons. For example, someone may have a viral infection and self- prescribed to left over into microbial that was prescribed for a bacterial infection. But that drug will have no effect as the viral infections. Drugs that are left over might be given to or taken by someone else who may have a serious allergy to the medicine and who for that reason would not be prescribed to medicine under the supervision of a physician. Finally, inappropriate use of drugs promotes drug resistance if the drug is taken for the wrong indication, the wrong duration, or in the wrong dosage. “Todd, what can people do about this how can the situation be improved?” “I think physicians, patients and parents of patients can take steps to improve the situation. First of all, physicians should prescribe the drug only when appropriate, only in the correct amount and only for the correct duration.

This was a handwritten news-sheet posted daily in the Forum at Rome and in other common meeting places around the city. Of course, a lot of the news would be out of date in the sense that, for example, it took a long time for reports of a victory in a distant country to get back to Rome. Nonetheless, a lot of the items included are similar to those found in more modern newspapers: news of battles, as already mentioned, as well as political and military appointments, political events, and even a social diary recording marriages, births, and deaths. One mustn't forget sport - if that is what you'd call it. Just like modern fans of football, sports-minded Romans could keep up with the latest results of the gladiator contests. People who lived in the provinces and wanted to be kept up to date would send scribes to Rome to copy the news and have them send it back by letter.

He observed that individuals differ in their inherited traits and that selection acts on such differences, leading to evolutionary change. Although Darwin realized that variation in heritable traits is a prerequisite for evolution , he did not know precisely how organisms pass heritable traits to their offspring. Just a few years after Darwin published The Origin of Species, Gregor Mendel wrote a groundbreaking paper on inheritance in pea plants. In that paper, Mendel proposed a model of inheritance in which organisms transmit discrete heritable units (now called genes) to their offspring.

So, what is eco-tourism? Well, it's a form of tourism which should not only protect but also actively improve our environment and its cultures. However, many forms of tourism which are presented as sustainable, nature-based and environmentally friendly are often not what they seem and this is rapidly becoming a somewhat thorny issue. Governments, as well as the tourism industry, promote eco-tourism but there are very well- founded concerns that in many instances it not only lacks adequate scientific foundations but is also not viable as a solution to the world's social and environmental problems, which of course is what eco- tourism is supposed to be about. Many eco·tourism holidays are really nothing more than a marketing ploy and indeed, in the worse cases, can be said to even threaten local cultures, economies and natural resource bases. The issue is further confused by the multitude of terms to describe types of travel, which supposedly protect the environment. Other than eco-tourism we have adventure travel, sustainable tourism, responsible tourism, nature-based travel, green travel and cultural tourism to name just a few.

And for that reason alone, one begins to really suspect that the genetic differences between people who lived 5,000 years ago is evidence that the difference between their cognitive functions and ours is not actually as large.
